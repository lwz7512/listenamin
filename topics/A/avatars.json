    "txt": "Most people know the word 'avatar'. Perhaps we all saw the movie with the same name. Avatars are becoming a normal part of our life. Well... I should say our online life. Almost everywhere you go on the Internet you see avatars. Sometimes it's a website asking you to make an avatar, and other times it's people's real avatars. Do you have one? Or two, or three? I see a lot of avatars that are kind of cute and look like Japanese anime. One of the most popular things is to choose an animal as an avatar. I always take a long time to choose my avatar. It's important to make one I really like. It has to be funny. I also like avatars that move. All of the best avatars I've seen move. They are usually very funny, and clever."
