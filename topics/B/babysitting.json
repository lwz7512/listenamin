    "txt": "I loved babysitting when I was younger. It was a really easy way to make money. All I had to do was sit in my neighbour’s house and look after the kids. That was the easy bit, because the kids were usually asleep in bed. The parents would give me a lot of money for watching DVDs and eating snacks. When I was even younger, I liked it when my babysitter came round. She would always play games with us and let us stay up late. She would send us to bed just before my parents came home. I know in some countries, babysitting isn’t so common. It isn’t part of the culture. I suppose that’s not such a bad thing. I read a lot in the papers nowadays about babysitters hitting the children because they don’t sleep. That’s really bad."
