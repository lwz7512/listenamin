    "txt": "I’m not the world’s biggest fan of banks. I’ve had too many bad experiences of them. I really don’t know how they can advertise and say they look after you. They don’t. Bank charges are way too high; you spend ages waiting to be served; and then they say no if you want a loan. The bank I bank with makes dozens of mistakes with my account. The thing they’re best at is making excuses. I’m not at all surprised so many banks did badly in the credit crisis. I hope they change. Bankers get far too much money. All they do is desk work. Banks need to focus a lot more on real customer service. At the moment banks only offer an excuse for customer service. They don’t even offer you a drink when you sit down and open an account."
