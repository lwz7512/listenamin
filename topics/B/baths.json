There’s nothing better in life than sinking into a hot bath and letting the water take away my troubles. A bath really makes you feel great. I especially like taking a bath before going to bed. Bath time is pretty much the only time of the day when you can really pamper yourself. It also means a lot of quality time to yourself. It’s perfect for listening to music and reading a good book. The only thing I don’t like about bath time is when I fall asleep and the water goes cold. Or even worse – when you want a bath and there’s no hot water."
