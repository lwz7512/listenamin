    "txt": "Getting married is one of the happiest days of anyone’s life. Being married is also full of happiness, but there are also many difficulties. It isn’t always easy to be married. You have to put up with your spouse’s bad habits and moods forever. You have to negotiate and compromise on many things from who’s first in the bathroom in the mornings to where you go on vacation. Of course, being married also has many wonderful sides to it. You have a lifelong friend who will love you forever. You share many wonderful times together and support each other through good and bad times. And you grow old together and look back on years of happy memories. I think being married is great for your soul."
