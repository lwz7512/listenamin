    "txt": "Being single has its advantages and disadvantages. I think it’s better to stay single when you’re young. You need to live and have fun. You also need the freedom to do what you want, when you want. Being single in your twenties gives you lots of time to go travelling, see the world and experience different things. Most people like being single in their twenties and then want to settle down in their thirties. I think being single later in life can be sad. All of your friends are married or attached and people tend to go out and party less. I think being single when you’re old would be very lonely. The longer you stay single, the harder it becomes to settle down. In some countries, people think you’re strange if you’re single later on in life."
