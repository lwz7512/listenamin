Sure, kids love birthdays because they get presents and get to eat cake. But when you get older, birthdays make you feel special. It’s your special day. Even if no one wishes you a happy birthday, it’s still your special day. A lot of my friends think I’m mad. They hate their birthdays because it means they’re another year older. I hope I get to celebrate my hundredth birthday. I’m not sure if I can blow out 100 candles though. When I look back at all my birthdays, it’s difficult to choose the best. I’ll just say my last birthday is always the best one."
