    "txt": "I hate the sight of blood. Looking at it makes me go all weak at the knees. I can’t even look at my own blood. I don’t know why. The thing I hate most is giving blood for a medical check. I fainted once after I saw my blood in a small bottle. If I have a nose bleed, I have to sit down for 30 minutes before I feel better. It’s impossible for me to watch operations on TV. I wish I could donate blood to others. I can’t. I know giving blood is really important, but I’m not brave enough. One thing about blood I do find interesting is blood types. I think your blood type can affect your personality. I know that in some countries, people with blood type A would not be a good romantic match for someone with blood type O."
