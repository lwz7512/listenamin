    "txt": "I’ve never understood bullying. Why do people have to make the life of another person so miserable? Why do they think they have the right to punch and kick someone they think is weaker than them. I was bullied when I was a child. It was a living hell. I was really afraid to go to school, for many, many years. I knew I was not safe during break times. It was always a group of bullies that got me in the corridors, or on the playing fields. They made me hate school. I know they also changed me for life. I have no confidence now. I’m 32 years old but I’m afraid to speak up for myself. The school bullies took away my belief in myself. They didn’t know that they would scar me for life. The physical scars have gone but not the emotional ones."
