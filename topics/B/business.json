    "txt": "Business isn’t so good at the moment. In fact, it’s the worst time for businesses for decades. Many businesses are going bust because of the global financial crisis. Even sound businesses like the car industry and electronics are going through a really bad time. Many small businesses have gone out of business. It’s a real shame because so many lives are being ruined. With a lot of businesses it’s a real fight for survival. I really respect people for trying to make a go of their business. I don’t have much business sense. I wouldn’t know where to start in opening my own business. I suppose the best thing would be to look at business startups on the Internet. An online business might be good. There seems to be less risk."
