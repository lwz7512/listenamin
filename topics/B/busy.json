    "txt": "Are you busy? Do you lead a busy life? It seems we get busier and busier in our lives. I hate being busy. I’d much rather have nothing to do. Being busy makes me stressed and I end up making mistakes or forgetting something. Who’s the busiest person you know? I bet he or she is really stressed. The busy people I know are always looking ahead to their next holiday… and then in their holiday they are busy doing other things. I think we busy ourselves with too many things. We need to learn to relax and take things slowly. Even at work we have to look busy, even if we’re not. When the boss comes, we tell our friends, “Look busy!” That’s silly. It would be great if the word ‘busy’ disappeared from the English language."
