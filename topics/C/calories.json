    "txt": "Do you ever think about or worry about the number of calories you eat and drink every day. It’s not really something I thought about when I was younger. But now I have to think about my calorie intake. I’m putting on weight and so need to be more careful with what I eat. This is difficult because all of the yummiest food has the most calories. I’ve found an answer to this problem. If I do lots of exercise, I can eat what I want and not have to worry about calories. I burn off 500 calories when I jog for an hour. This means I can have a pizza and dessert and not feel guilty. I wish there was more information about calories in restaurants. It would make it easier for me to know what to eat and what to avoid."
