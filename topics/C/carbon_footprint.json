    "txt": "We have to do something about pollution. Even though there are warnings about global warming, companies don’t do anything to reduce pollution. Our sky, air, rivers, beaches and countryside are becoming rubbish dumps. The air is so polluted it is giving children breathing problems. Polluted rivers have no fish left in them and beaches are too dangerous to walk on because of the garbage everywhere. It seems a lot of people don’t care. I think there should be big fines for polluters. I don’t mind paying more for things if they can be made with less pollution. The problem is that companies are more interested in profits than pollution. We have only just started looking at our carbon footprint."
