    "txt": "Choosing a career is one of the biggest decisions we make in life. It used to be that we chose only one career. People would start a job when they were 18, 19 or 20 and stay in that same career for life. Their career path was quite straightforward. Nowadays, it is normal for people to change careers, five, six, seven times. New technology and globalization means things change quickly. We need to study and keep up with all the changes. I’ve had four different careers now. I like moving from one job to another. It means life never gets boring. It’s much better to keep learning different things in different careers. I have no idea what career I’ll choose next. Perhaps one that doesn’t even exists today."
