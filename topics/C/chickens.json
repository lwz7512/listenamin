    "txt": "Chickens are so important to many of us because they are a major part of our diet. Every country has so many chicken dishes, and eggs are one of the most common foods around. Chickens are also cute. Well, chickens aren’t, but chicks are - cute, fluffy chicks that make everyone go ‘aaahh’. It’s strange though that the word ‘chicken’ is used in so many English idioms. When I was at high school, you couldn’t ‘chicken out’ – to not do something because of being scared. Things are different today - I’m no spring chicken (that means I’m no longer young) so no one calls me a chicken any more. I work now - as a teacher. I get chicken feed (low wages) but I like my job. I plan to retire before I’m 50, but I’m not going to count my chickens before they’re hatched. This means I won’t quit working until I have enough money."
