    "txt": "Children are angels. Most of the time this is true. I’m very lucky because my two children really are the greatest angels. I think I won the children lottery with my kids. I could not have asked for lovelier, happier, sweeter little children. They have brought me endless amounts of joy since the second they were born. Everything they do fascinates me. Everything they say makes me smile. Watching them grow up is my greatest pleasure. In a way, it’s a little sad. I always want them to stay the age they’re at now. When they were 18 months old, I thought that was the cutest age. I thought the same when they were two, and then three and then four. I guess however old they are, they’re perfect. I wish all the children in the world were as happy as mine."
