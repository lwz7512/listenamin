    "txt": "I think Christmas is one of the happiest times of the year. Everyone has a smile on their face, especially children. It’s such an exciting time for kids. They can’t wait to open their presents and play with all of their new games and toys. It’s a nice time for adults too. They can catch up with their families and relax. Traditionally, the mother of the family is busiest at Christmas. She does most of the Christmas shopping and wraps the presents. Of course, she also spends hours cooking Christmas dinner. Let’s not forget the true meaning of Christmas, though. It is not about shopping and Christmas trees and ‘Frosty the Snowman’. It’s all about love for each other and peace around the world. Let’s hope this message stays alive."
