I read almost every day that climate change is changing the Earth forever. Many species of animal, fish, insect, frog, etc. are dying. The ice caps in the Arctic and Antarctica are melting. Our weather is changing so places are getting warmer, or colder, or are having more and stronger hurricanes. We all need to do our bit so that climate change does not destroy us. Itâ€™s important to cut down on things that produce greenhouse gasses. These warm the planet and change the climate. Doing simple things like turning off lights and recycling paper all help."
