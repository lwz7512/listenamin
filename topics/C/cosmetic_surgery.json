    "txt": "Would you like to change your face and body? Would you like movie star looks? A lot of people want to do this. They pay lots of money to go to a cosmetic surgeon and change their appearance. The most common operation we call a nose job. People who are unhappy with their nose have it reshaped. Other people want their wrinkles to disappear to make themselves look younger. People also go under the knife and have things made bigger or smaller. I think this is a waste of money. I'm not the best-looking person in the world but I would never consider plastic surgery - even if it was free. Some people have so many operations they end up looking like theyâ€™re  made of plastic. I'd rather stay looking human."
