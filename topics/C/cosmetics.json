If you think about it. they’re amazingly expensive. Why does a lipstick or a small tube of cream cost so much? The really expensive cosmetics don’t actually make you look that different than really cheap ones. A lot depends too on your skill – choosing the right colours to match your face, and how you put your make-up on. I sometimes laugh at the ladies selling cosmetics in department stores. They’re meant to be experts but they look like clowns. I mean, do they really need to paint their faces? One thing I worry about is whether the chemicals damage your skin."
