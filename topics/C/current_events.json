    "txt": "I love the news and current events. I’m addicted to what’s happening in the world. It doesn’t matter what kind of news it is, I love watching it. Even if it’s from countries I’ve never heard of. I’ll even watch the same news programme three or four times and not get bored. I guess it’s so fascinating because it’s real. I get really interested in a story when it breaks, then like to follow it as it unfolds. Following current events makes you quite knowledgeable. I know most of the world’s capitals and most of the world’s leaders. Watching the news is really looking at history happening now. But you never know what’s going to happen next. Every time you turn on the news or read a news story, you’ll find something unexpected."
