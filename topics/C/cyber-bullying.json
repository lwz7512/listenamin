    "txt": "The Internet can be a scary place these days, especially because of cyber-bullying. It’s difficult to open a newspaper these days and not see a story about this. It’s a really nasty and growing problem. Cyber-bullies are real cowards. They hide behind their computer and scare people, send them hate mail or threaten them. Even worse is when they publish pictures of their victims online. I have a friend who had a really bad time at the hands of a cyber-bully. He or she spread lots of gossip and lies on the Internet. My friend’s reputation was badly damaged. A really bad thing is how young cyber-bullying starts. Many schoolchildren physically bully others in class and then continue online. Their victim isn’t safe anywhere."
