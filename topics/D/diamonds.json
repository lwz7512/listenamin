    "txt": "There’s a famous song that says “Diamonds are a girl’s best friend”. Is that true? Do all women like diamonds? They are certainly very beautiful, especially when you see them sparkling. But really, only rich people can afford diamonds. When I bought my wife’s wedding ring, we could only afford a smallish diamond. There were lots of beautiful rings in the store with huge diamonds but they all cost an arm and a leg. One day I’ll buy her a big diamond as a surprise. Nowadays you have to worry where diamonds come from. Many countries sell diamonds to buy guns and tanks. These are called blood diamonds. If you buy a diamond, make sure it has a certificate so you know which country it came from."
