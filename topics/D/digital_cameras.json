    "txt": "Digital cameras are so useful. I love my digital camera. I take it everywhere with me. My friends think I’m mad, but I’ve got thousands of really good photos. Digital cameras are so much better than the old cameras with film. They’re also much better than mobile phone cameras. My digital camera fits in my pocket and takes great photos. I usually take a few photos every day and then put them online for my friends to see. The best thing about digital cameras is that they are so easy to use. It’s child’s play. The good thing is that digital cameras today give the same quality photos as you could only get on really expensive cameras. All you need is 10 to 12 megapixels. That’s more than enough."
