    "txt": "I’m hopeless at giving directions. I get very confused. I’m sure I send people in totally the wrong direction. For some reason, I always get stopped for directions in the street. I can usually direct someone if it’s just a block or two, but that’s it. If it’s half way across town, I’ll send you in the opposite direction, guaranteed. The funniest thing is asking for directions in another language. I’m pretty good at saying where I want to go, but when I receive the directions, I understand nothing. I nod my head and smile and say “thank you very much”. The person walks away thinking I understood the directions. I’m impressed by people who can give directions from one town to another. They must have a map inside their head!"
