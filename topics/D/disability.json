    "txt": "I think disability can be a difficult thing to understand. It's a word that means many different things. A disability can affect people's body, intelligence and emotions. It makes it more difficult for people to do everyday things properly. Disabled people might tell us something different. Many people with disabilities show us how strong the human spirit is. There are so many people who have been badly injured in accidents, or who were disabled from birth, who are world-class athletes or excel in other areas. It must be hard to deal with disability if it comes to you suddenly. In richer countries, there are support systems to help these people. In poorer countries, they can have a really tough time. Hopefully this will change one day."
