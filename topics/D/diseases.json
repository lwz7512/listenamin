Think about the amount of overpopulation if no one died from diseases. There’d be a population explosion. I don’t think the Earth would be able to feed so many people. It’s a really difficult question. Some diseases in the world are really horrible and cause a lot of suffering. It would be great if scientists found cures for those. Scientists have already found a cure for many diseases. It’s amazing how far science and medicine have come. I think more cures for diseases could be found if governments spent more money. They seem to spend so little on controlling disease."
