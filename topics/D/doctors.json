    "txt": "Doctors are cool. They spend all their day helping people and saving lives. There can’t be many better jobs in the world. I wanted to be a doctor when I was a kid but I was no good at science. I think doctors are among the most important people in society. They should get paid lots and lots of money. It’s not right that bankers get paid more. Doctors are really clever and very kind. They never seem to panic or get angry. Every time I’ve seen a doctor, he or she has always made me feel better – not just because of their treatment, but also because of their kindness. It must be amazing being a doctor and knowing all kinds of stuff about the human body. It would be pretty useful being a doctor because then you’d know what was wrong with your own body."
