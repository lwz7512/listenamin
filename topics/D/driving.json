    "txt": "Driving is one of life’s greatest pleasures. There’s nothing better than getting behind the wheel and going for a drive. I live in the countryside, so it’s easy to get out onto an open road. I open the windows and turn the music up and then just drive and drive. I like driving to new areas and finding new roads. I find it very relaxing and great fun. I like the speed and the freedom. I even like driving in towns and cities, although not when traffic is really heavy. It’s not much fun being stuck in a traffic jam half the day. Driving in different countries is great fun. I’m a little nervous at first, but I soon get to know the roads. People have different ways of driving in different countries. I don’t like countries that have aggressive drivers."
