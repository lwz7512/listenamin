    "txt": "Drugs are becoming a big problem in many societies. When I was growing up, you rarely heard about drugs. Now, they’re everywhere. Children in schools are smoking marijuana and taking harder drugs. There were many kids at my school who smoked. Nicotine was the most serious drug they used. Today’s kids seem to have access to all kinds of drugs. I don’t know what the government should do about it. Some countries have legalized drugs like marijuana, but others have made it a crime to possess even the smallest amount. You can even go to prison for having a tiny, tiny bit. Governments need to do something before society ends up in a real mess. I’m not sure what the solution is."
