    "txt": "Eating is the best thing ever. I love eating. Any time of the day or night I can eat…. and eat and eat and eat. I have a very big appetite. I always have. My mother used to complain about how much I ate. She used to ask me if I had a hole in my stomach. Eating is very, very satisfying. There are many different aspects of eating. It fills us up and stops us feeling hungry. Food tastes so good and eating it makes us feel very happy. Sometimes I feel like I’m in heaven when I’m eating – especially chocolate fudge cheesecake. Yum. Eating is also a great social activity. I love eating with my family, with my friends or even at work. Eating can also be an international experience. Eating is great just about anywhere you eat."
