    "txt": "My energy levels go up and down. Sometimes I’m full of energy, and sometimes I’m drained of energy. Mornings are when my energy levels are high. I wake up ready to go. I don’t need 30 minutes to wake up, like some people I know. For some reason the food I eat doesn’t affect how energetic I am. Some people feel tired after lunch, while others complain they need to eat something for an energy boost. I seem to have the same level of energy even if I eat nothing all day. The one thing that does affect my energy is the weather. A bright, sunny day gives me lots of energy. A dull, rainy day makes me feel less energetic. I also have a lot of energy if I’m doing something exciting – even if it’s study or work."
