    "txt": "Exercise is something most of us love to hate. A lot of us avoid it altogether. I do a lot of exercise, but not because I like it. I do it because it helps me stay slim and healthy. I always feel great after exercising, so there are good parts to it. The thing I hate most is getting ready. It’s really difficult after a hard day’s work to come home and then prepare for your exercises. I really don’t want to do it when I’m getting changed. I hate the warm-up stretching. I also hate the first few minutes of a run, swim or cycle. But then once my lungs stop burning, I settle into a rhythm and things aren’t so bad. Recently I bought an exercise bike. Sitting in my house cycling to loud music or watching TV is a great way to get some exercise."
