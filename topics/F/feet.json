They even have problems trying to buy shoes that fit them. My feet are pretty normal. They’ve been very useful down the years. I’ve done a lot of running, loads of hiking and played thousands of hours of football. I’ve never injured my feet or my ankles. I sometimes get sore feet when I go shopping. That seems to be the only thing my feet don’t like. That and new shoes. New shoes usually give me blistered feet. Oh yes… and the cold. My feet hate the cold. My toes go numb. Especially my big toe. One thing I’m happy about is that I don’t have smelly feet."
