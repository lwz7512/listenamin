    "txt": "People say first impressions count. What do you think? Can you understand a lot about someone from the very first time you see them or meet them? I think I’m good at judging someone’s character from the first time I set eyes on them. It’s easy to understand if the person is my kind of person. First impressions count most when you meet someone important. If you have a job interview, it’s very important to give a good first impression. The interviewer can decide if they like you as soon as you walk through the door. Are you well-dressed? Do you look happy? Do you greet the interviewer? All these things are important. I also think first impressions count when you meet your future in-laws."
