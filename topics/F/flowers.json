    "txt": "Flowers are a true gift from God. They’re beautiful. All of them. One of life’s pleasures is looking at flowers. If you look at them really closely, it’s amazing just how beautiful they are. Their colours are so rich and deep. I don’t know of anything in the world more red than a rose or more yellow than a tulip. Flowers seem to be a big part of every culture. People give flowers as gifts, arrange them in their houses, grow them in their gardens. Some people even name their daughters after flowers. I can’t imagine how boring the world would be without flowers. I’m always coming across new flowers. Every time I travel to another country, I find lots of flowers I’ve never seen before. It must be nice to be a bee and spend all day flying from flower to flower."
