    "txt": "I absolutely love flying. I love everything about it, from buying my air ticket to getting off the plane and collecting my baggage. There’s something very special about getting on an airplane. It’s always a real adventure. I like short flights and long-haul flights. Many people say economy class is terrible, but I like it. There isn’t enough legroom but I don’t mind that. Many people also say they hate airplane food. I love it. The only thing I don’t like about flying is turbulence. I think that’s really scary. I always worry the plane will crash. Another thing I don’t like is waiting to get off when the plane stops. It takes ages before the flight attendants open the doors. One day I want to fly business class and first class."
