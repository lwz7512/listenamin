The football World Cup is the biggest event on Earth. It’s bigger than the Olympics. More people watch the Final on TV than any other event. Football also brings nations together. The greatest of enemies put aside their differences for 90 minutes to play a football match. Then there are the teams, like Real Madrid, Manchester United and Liverpool. These names are more well known across the world than the top basketball or baseball teams. A famous coach once said: “Football isn’t a matter of life and death; it’s more important.”"
