    "txt": "I’m not sure how many people ever stop to think how wonderful four seasons are. I think people who live in cities don’t care about the seasons. City people spend half their lives indoors or underground. I live in the country and I love watching the seasons come and go. Every day is different in the countryside. I love watching the crops grow in the fields. I watch them push their way up from the ground in the spring and then grow tall in the summer sun. Just before autumn arrives, the farmer harvests them and then winter comes. Seasons means it’s like living in a new place every four months. Everything changes. One wonderful thing about seasons is the seasonal food you get. There’s always something tasty that’s just come in season."
