    "txt": "Freedom is a funny thing. It seems to mean different things in different countries. People in my country say they have freedom, but I don’t think so. We have to go to school, we have to pay tax, we have to work, we have to do lots of things. That’s not freedom. I’d say we have more freedom than people in other countries. There are many countries in the world where people are like slaves. They can’t leave the country, can’t get a passport, and have to work 16 hours a day. I wonder what a society would be like if everyone was totally free to do anything they wanted. It would probably be a total mess. No one would work. I suppose freedom means having some rules to follow."
