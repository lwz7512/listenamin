    "txt": "Someone once told me that French fries are not French. There must be some connection between fries and France, otherwise they wouldn’t be called French Fries. Wherever they are from, I love them. I guess they’re the most popular food in the world. Everyone eats French fries. They are very versatile – you can eat them with so many things. You can even have a French Fries sandwich. People put all sorts of things on top of French fries. I love ketchup and mayonnaise on my fries – both together. You have to have salt. The only time I don’t like fries is when they are cold. I get angry if I get fries that aren’t hot in a fast food restaurant. I take them back immediately. All of this talk of French fries has made me want to eat some."
