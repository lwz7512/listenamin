My best friends and I all grew up together and shared so many experiences together. We know everything about each other. I would do anything for my friends and I’m sure they’d do anything for me. I’m sure there’s nothing in the world that could stop us from being friends. I’ve also made lots of other good friends from university and the different places I’ve worked. They are also important to me. We are now all over the world and it’s sometimes difficult to meet each other, but we stay in touch. One day I’d like to get all of my friends together for a big party. That’d be great fun."
