    "txt": "Frustration is a terrible thing. In fact, it’s a frustrating thing. Getting frustrated is one of life’s biggest frustrations. I wish I didn’t get frustrated, but there are so many things in life that are frustrating. I think the biggest thing recently is computers. Getting a new computer out of the box can be frustrating. Understanding how everything works is doubly frustrating. And then there are all the frustrations with programmes that freeze, web pages that don’t open, and things you lose. I wonder why we get so frustrated. I think we could do things better if we relaxed and did everything slowly. I wonder if animals and birds get frustrated. I’m sure a lot of the things we humans do causes them a lot of frustration."
