    "txt": "If I could, I’d never go to another funeral again. No one likes funerals, of course, but for me, they make me so sad. I can’t stop crying. Quite often I’m the only person crying. Everything about a funeral makes me cry. When I open the invitation, tears well up in my eyes. When I see the funeral procession drive by, I start. The actual ceremony is almost unbearable. I have never learnt to control my sobs. If you hear someone sniffing non –stop, that’s me. The music at funerals is unnecessarily sad. I’ve told my friends I want salsa music at my funeral. And I don’t want people to wear black. I also hope the party after the funeral isn’t a sad occasion. People should laugh and remember the funny times."
