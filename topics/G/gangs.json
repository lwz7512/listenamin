    "txt": "Gangs are becoming a big problem in many countries around the world. We’ve always had gangs, and they’ve always created problems. Recently, things seem to be getting out of control. Gangs are taking over our streets. In many parts of South America, gangs kill because of drugs. In many parts of Europe, gangs hang around on street corners and hassle anyone who walks by. There’s a lot of pressure for young people to join a gang. If a young person doesn’t join a gang, they might be bullied at school. The government always says gangs are a problem, but they never do anything about it. I was in a gang when I was younger. It’s scary when I look back on it. We used to have lots of fights and do many bad things. I never had a knife."
