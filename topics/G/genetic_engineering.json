    "txt": "I think the idea of genetic engineering is fascinating. It’s also quite dangerous. Fiddling around with what makes us human might make us less human. We could end up creating a Frankenstein’s monster. The idea of genetic engineering has been around for centuries. Scientists have always wanted to change us. The real breakthrough came in the latter half of last century. Geneticists cracked the genetic code and found ways of altering our genes. Now they can clone animals and reproduce human tissue and organs. I don’t think it’ll be too long before scientists clone a person. Once all the fuss has died down, younger generations will be more accepting of genetic engineering. We might even live to be two hundred years old."
