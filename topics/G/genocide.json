    "txt": "I really donâ€™t understand why genocide happens. Every five or ten years we hear about the latest genocide. Every time we hear about it, governments say it will never happen again. After the genocide in Rwanda, the USA and other world powers promised to stop any future killing. Then Darfur came along and all they do is talk. If a crazy government wants to kill thousands of innocent civilians, no one can stop them. Genocide is the biggest shame in our history. Countries go to war because of oil, but not to stop innocent people being murdered. Only recently has the international community started chasing those who organize genocide. The International Criminal Court prosecutes those who commit crimes against humanity."
