It all begins with the proposal. After that comes setting the date. Once the couple know the wedding day, it’s planning, planning and planning. They have to decide where to get married, who to invite, what kind of flowers, where to have the reception, and a million and one other things. Getting married can be a very expensive occasion. Some parents save all their lives to pay for their son’s or daughter’s wedding. Getting married seems to be similar all over the world. The happy couple make some vows in front of their guests and then there is a big party after."
