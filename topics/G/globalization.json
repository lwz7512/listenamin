    "txt": "What does globalization mean? We always hear this word on TV and read about it in newspapers. It means the world is now a village – the global village. The world has become smaller. Of course, the world did not shrink and it isn’t a village. Because of better transport, the Internet and more trading between countries, it is easier to do business. Japanese car makers have factories in Thailand; American computer companies employ thousands of people in China. That’s globalization. And don’t forget the millions of call centre jobs in India that workers in America and Europe used to do. Globalization also means it is easier to work in another country. Is globalization a good or bad thing? That’s a difficult question to answer."
