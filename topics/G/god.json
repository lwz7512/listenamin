    "txt": "God created us all. God created life. God created everything around us. I often try to think what was before God. But God has always been there, so there was nothing before God. I wonder why God always appears as a man with a beard in books. He’s also usually a white man. No one knows if God is a man or a woman. God is also different to different religions. Most people in the world pray to God. They ask for forgiveness when they do something wrong; they thank God for bringing good things and ask for God’s help when things go wrong. People who believe in God get strength from their belief. They know that God is looking down on them. One thing I don’t understand is why there is so much killing and bad things in the world."
