    "txt": "What was life like before Google? This might look like a silly and strange question, but it is a good one. Google has changed our lives. In an amazingly short space of time, the verb ‘google’ has entered our language. I think everything about Google is amazing. It helps us so much. We can find any information we want just by typing in what we want in the search box. I even like the Google home page. It’s so simple. You know, I can’t remember the last time a day went by when I didn’t use Google for something. I wonder what Google will be like in the future. Only those at Google know. The strange thing about the Internet is that something we don’t even know about yet might come along and totally replace Google overnight."
