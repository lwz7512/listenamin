    "txt": "Ten years ago the word “hacking” didn’t mean much to anyone. I think it meant cutting something very roughly. Now we all need to be aware of hacking. It is a big problem. Hacking has turned into a major crime. Hackers are stealing people’s identities, money, personal information and using them illegally. Hackers are also breaking into top secret government computers to steal classified information. Many spies are using hackers to get the information they want. Many people say the next world war will be fought by hackers in cyber-space. You really need to be careful what information you put online. It’s also really important to keep your security up to date on your computer. You need the latest firewalls and anti-virus software."
