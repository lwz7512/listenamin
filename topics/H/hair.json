    "txt": "I never know what to do with my hair. Sometimes I want it long, sometimes I want to cut it all off. My hair is a little unmanageable. It never does what I want it to. It’s very thick. When it’s long and I have lots of split ends so I have to go to the hairdresser’s for a trim. I also have dandruff, which is a little embarrassing when I wear dark sweaters. I don’t often have a bad hair day. This usually only happens when I have to meet someone important. My hair sticks out all over the place. I hate it. I always think everyone is looking at me, or looking at my misbehaving hair. I often wonder what it would be like if we had no hair - if we were all bald. We could save lots of money on shampoos and conditioners."
