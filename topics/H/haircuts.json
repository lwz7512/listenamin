    "txt": "I wonder how many times we have our hair cut in our life. Hundreds. It would also be interesting to know how many different hairstyles we have. I know the styles I had when I was younger would look silly today. I really like haircuts. It’s interesting sitting in the hairdresser’s chair and watching the stylist do things. I often think a good haircut is like art and the hairdresser is the artist. I have had a few disastrous haircuts – usually when they cut too much off. I need a long fringe because my face is a strange shape. The best thing I like about haircuts is having a chat to the hairdresser. He or she can usually talk about anything and everything. I also like the smell of everything when I’m sitting in the chair."
