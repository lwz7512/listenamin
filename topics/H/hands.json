We can do so many different things with our hands. We can hold things, squeeze things, feel things. We can swing on jungle gyms, write and type letters; the list is endless. I think hands are a very beautiful part of the body, if they are well looked after. It’s interesting to see how many different parts there are to our hands. We have a palm, fingers, knuckles, life lines, fingertips and the back of our hand. There are lots of good things you can do with your hands. I like holding hands – of course with my wife and children."
