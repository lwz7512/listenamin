    "txt": "A hangover is one of the worst feelings you can have. There’s nothing you can do to make it go away. You just have to wait for it to wear off. It usually takes a whole day and can even take two days to disappear. The most stupid thing about a hangover is that you never learn. A hangover is your body’s warning that too much alcohol is bad for you. When something is painful, you never do it again. Not so with a hangover. When people have a hangover, they often drink again the next day. This makes your original hangover much worse. Many people have their own hangover “cure”. None of them work for me. All I can do is suffer. I suppose the best thing for a hangover is not to drink at all, or at least not drink too much."
