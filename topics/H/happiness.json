    "txt": "Happiness is sitting on a beach with a good book and no more work and studying for a year. Ahhhh… if only. What’s your idea of happiness? It’s such an important thing. I like Bhutan’s idea (Bhutan is the small country next to Nepal). There, they prefer to measure happiness instead of money. The most important thing for Bhutan’s government is how happy the people are. What a fantastic idea this is. Imagine if governments focused on making us all happy. They could spend money on beaches and free ice cream instead of fighting wars. I looked at everyone on the train this morning. No one looked happy. Maybe the news should be full of happy stories instead of the usual doom and gloom."
