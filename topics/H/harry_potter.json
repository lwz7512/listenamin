    "txt": "Harry Potter is a boy wizard who has taken over the world. He is everywhere. No one had heard of Harry Potter before 1997. That’s when J.K. Rowling published her first book. She’s the creator of Harry Potter. The first novel was called ‘Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone’ and it became an amazing success. Everyone was talking about it and Harry became an overnight phenomenon. Six more Harry Potter books followed and they all became best sellers. People went crazy over every new book. My friends waited overnight outside a bookstore to make sure they got their copy of the latest book. My friends are 40 years old! Harry Potter is now a global industry, with movies and merchandise of all kinds. It’s amazing how big he is."
