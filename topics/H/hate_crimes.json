    "txt": "Hate crime is becoming a big problem in many societies. You’d think that in the twenty-first century we’d all respect each other. With all the communications we have and with globalization, we should know enough about each other to understand we are all the same. We should at least be able to respect our differences. I blame the media for a lot of hate crime. They are very good at highlighting particular groups of people and casting them in a negative light. Just look at what’s happened since the 9/11 attacks in New York. Hate has increased in the world and the media seems to fuel this. I’m glad I live in a country that has laws against hate crime. They don’t always work, but at least it’s better than in most countries."
