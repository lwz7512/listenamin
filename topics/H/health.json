    "txt": "I never used to worry about my health until recently. When I was a kid, I did loads of exercise. Even in my twenties and thirties I was very fit and never ill. I have been lucky all my life – always in the best of health. I rarely get even a cold. I suppose time catches up with you. Now I seem to be getting lots of little aches and pains. I should go to the doctor for a health check, but I’m too busy. The older you get, the more you worry about your health. One good thing is that I’m eating more healthily now than ever before. I no longer have fast food and midnight snacks. I also sleep a lot more. I’ve read that getting seven or eight hours sleep every night is one of the best things you can do for your health."
