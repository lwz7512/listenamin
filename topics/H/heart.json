Or perhaps we know, but don’t do enough to keep our heart in a healthy condition. Our heart is an amazing thing, when you think about it. It beats so fast for years and years and years, pumping millions of litres of blood around our body. It keeps working, even though we do so many bad things to it. It really is the source of our life. We need to promise our heart every day that we’ll look after it properly. I think kids born today are lucky. Modern medicine and science will soon have all the answers to keep our heart strong. Even today we’re lucky. Doctors can replace your heart via a heart transplant."
