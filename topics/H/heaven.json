    "txt": "I wonder if heaven exists. I guess if heaven is real, then hell must be real too. I think heaven must be a great place if it’s better than Earth. It’s difficult to believe that heaven is a place that looks like paradise. Pretty much every religion in the world believes that heaven is real. I don’t think it’s full of angels with wings though. I think there are lots of heavenly places on Earth. Anywhere in the countryside is heaven to me. Sitting on a beach with blue skies is also heaven. You can even be in heaven in the city. Walking into a cool, air-conditioned building from a hot, sweaty street is heaven. I also find heaven in food. A double chocolate fudge and nut ice cream with maple syrup and extra whipped cream is simply heaven."
