    "txt": "I don’t really have a hero. There are many people I respect, but they are not really my hero. Some people choose very strange heroes. My friends have rock stars and football players as heroes. Of course, these people are very good at what they do, but they’re not really heroes. They get lots of money for doing what they love. When they’re not singing or playing football, I wonder what they’re doing. I think most of the world’s heroes are unsung heroes. People who work to help others every day. We generally don’t notice these heroes. Then there are those who put their lives on the line for others. Fire fighters, police officers and soldiers are heroes. Without them, the world would be less safe."
