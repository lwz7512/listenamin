    "txt": "Some people love hiking and some people hate it. Personally, I don’t really like it. I don’t see the point of walking for miles and miles up and down mountains. You get all sweaty and out of breath. The worst thing is that the next day all your muscles ache. Of course it’ll rain, so you’ll get soaking wet. If it’s sunny, you’ll get sunburn. To make things really bad, you might fall over and twist your ankle or get stung by a bee. I have terrible memories of hiking when I was a child. My parents always wanted to get to the top of the mountain, and then the next mountain top, and then the next. No matter how much we complained, they always said: “It’s not far.” Never believe anyone who says that, especially someone who loves hiking."
