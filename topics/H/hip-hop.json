Most of my friends aren’t into it either. My sons are. They love it. They’re into the fashion and the music. They never seem to stop dancing to it. When I went to America, I took them to an exhibition on hip-hop. It’s an important part of America’s culture now. It’s also a unique aspect of America’s cultural history. Many people thought hip-hop was a passing fashion; that something would replace it. The truth is quite different. Hip-hop has almost become mainstream. You know when that happens because everyone else in the world tries to copy it. Hip-hop is huge all over the world."
