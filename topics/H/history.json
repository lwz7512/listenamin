As I got older, I realized history is the study of how we got here today. It’s a long journey that describes all the wars, great people, inventions, disasters, etc that have brought us to this point in time. I now love any kind of history. It’s fascinating to visit a new country and learn about its history. Watching the news today is like seeing history unfold. Lots of the things I learnt at school now make the news more interesting. History provides us with the perfect background information to a news story."
