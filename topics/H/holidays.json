I recently had an eight-week holiday and it flew by. It seems as though time goes quickly when we are on holiday, and slowly when we are at school or work. I always really look forward to holidays – even one-day holidays are great. I live in a country that has many national holidays, so there’s always a break around the corner. I feel sorry for some workers who only get two or three weeks holiday a year. They can’t do anything or go anywhere. I love holidays even if I don’t go away. Staying at home is just as good as going on holiday somewhere. Sometimes going on holiday is stressful."
