    "txt": "I think home schooling is great. I wish my parents had done this. The idea of never going to school sounds too good to be true. I hated school. I wanted to stay at home every day. I really wouldn’t have minded staying at home and studying. Of course, you need to be careful not to forget studying. One thing about home schooling I like is visiting museums or watching documentaries to learn more. This is so much better than learning in school. I think my learning at school suffered because there were many kids who didn’t want to learn. I could have got better marks if I had stayed at home. Perhaps there’ll be more home schooling in the future because of the Internet."
