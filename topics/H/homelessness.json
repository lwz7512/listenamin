    "txt": "Homelessness is a terrible thing. It really shouldn’t exist today. A country should be ashamed if anyone is homeless. Governments are so rich today, yet they have no money to provide basic needs for their citizens. This is rubbish. Think how much money governments waste on fancy cars and other unnecessary things. It’s a crime. Even in rich countries, there are thousands of homeless. The government tries to sweep them under the carpet. They want to pretend the problem doesn’t exist. The world’s richest countries spend billions of dollars on weapons, but can’t make sure people have a roof over their head. This is disgusting. All world leaders should be ashamed of themselves. I feel so sorry for the homeless."
