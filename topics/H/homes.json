    "txt": "“Home is where the heart is.” That’s so true. I’ve lived in many different houses during my life but not all of them have been home. When you are growing up, home is where your family lives. I left home when I was 18 and slowly my childhood home was no longer. Now it’s my parents’ house and not my home. I moved around a lot and only spent a year or so in most places I lived. They never really felt like home. A home is somewhere you feel totally relaxed and want to come home to. The expression “Home Sweet Home” is also true. You have to have nice feelings about it to call it home. Home doesn’t have to be in your home country. I’ve lived in several countries and have had a home in all of them."
