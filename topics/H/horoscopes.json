    "txt": "I totally do not believe in horoscopes. I canâ€™t think of anything more ridiculous. Perhaps the only thing more ridiculous is the number of people who read their horoscopes and believe what they say. I mean, just how can a horoscope be true? How is it that the same things are true for half-a-billion people born between January 23 and February 22. It makes no sense. Not all of those people will be lucky in love and have a nice financial surprise at the beginning of the month. Horoscopes are a part of many cultures. Every time I go to another country I see the horoscope in magazines. I have a friend who has the same star sign as me. Our lives and fortunes are very different. That proves to me that horoscopes are rubbish."
