    "txt": "I don’t really like hospitals. I have many bad memories of them. I’ve stayed in hospital seven times in my life. I guess I must be unlucky. My friends all say I’m accident prone. My longest stay in hospital was for three months. That was boring. I had lots of visitors but staying in bed for that length of time isn’t much fun. The worst thing was hospital food. I couldn’t wait to get out and have some real food. The strange thing is that I really like watching TV dramas and movies about hospitals. It feels like I know everything that’s going on. I wouldn’t like to work in a hospital though. I hate the smell and the sight of blood. I’ll do my best from now on to stay away from hospitals, unless I’m visiting someone else."
