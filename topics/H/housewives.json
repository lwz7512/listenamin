    "txt": "I think being a housewife is a very demanding job. Most housewives have a lot to do, especially if they have children. Of course, some have an easy time because they have a maid or a tiny house. Most housewives though are working pretty much from the time they wake up to the time they go to bed. They have to get up the earliest to cook everyoneâ€™s breakfast. Then they have to do the dishes, start the washing, iron and then go shopping to buy the food. Before their children go to school, the housewife has to make their packed lunches. I reckon cooking three meals a day every single day can be pretty tiring. Afternoons are just as busy, and then it all starts again when everyone comes home from school and work!"
