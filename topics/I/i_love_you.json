    "txt": "Love makes the world go round, not money. I agree with the centuries-old quote that says, ‘Love conquers all’. It’s true when you think about it. So much has been written about love. It must be one of the most written and talked about topics ever. How many songs and poems are there about love? Millions. Billions, perhaps. Love is everywhere. You can’t pass a single day without hearing someone say ‘love’. It is one of the most beautiful words in any language. Your heart can melt when someone says, ‘I love you’. It’s also very important to tell people you love them. You should do it every day. There are many different kinds of love and they are all important. Except perhaps when you love pizza or burgers. That’s not healthy."
