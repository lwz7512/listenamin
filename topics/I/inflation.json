    "txt": "Inflation seems to be a big issue at the moment. Every time I turn on the news there is a story about inflation. Many countries around the world are fighting to keep inflation under control. Sometimes you read about countries that lose the battle against inflation. Zimbabwe once had an inflation rate of trillions of percent. I canâ€™t imagine trying to add up my shopping bill with so many zeroes. I have no idea how they brought it under control. Inflation in my country is OK at the moment. The government is worried about prices going up. Me too. Inflation seems to be the thing economists worry about most. They do everything they can to keep the rate of inflation low. It has been pretty stable for years now."
