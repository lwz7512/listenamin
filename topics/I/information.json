To get ahead, you need the latest information. I’m not really sure how much information we need. Our brains can only handle a certain amount of information at a time. I reckon a lot of us have information overload. I’m sure before computers came along this didn’t happen. One problem with computers is the amount of personal information online. I worry about putting confidential info on different websites. Of course the great thing about computers is that we have so much information at our disposal. That’s pretty useful."
