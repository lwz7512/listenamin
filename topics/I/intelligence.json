    "txt": "People say intelligence is a lot more attractive than beauty. I often ask people if they would prefer a partner who is intelligent or good looking. They almost always say they want someone who is intelligent. I wonder why it is some of us are so intelligent and others aren’t. Surely we are all born with a similar level of intelligence. I’m not really sure how intelligent I am. Sometimes I think I’m intelligent, but then I do something really dumb. Or I meet someone who is super-brainy who makes me feel unintelligent. One day, I’m going to take one of those intelligence tests to measure my IQ. Another thing I don’t get about intelligence is how people think our leaders are so intelligent, but then the leaders do such stupid things. Do intelligent people start wars?"
