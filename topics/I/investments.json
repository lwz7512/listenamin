    "txt": "I’m totally hopeless with money. I’ve never really understood things like investments. I should be more interested in investments because I know I’ll get more money. I find everything very confusing. I never know what to invest in. Some of my friends invest in stocks and shares. I never did this. I’m happy because I didn’t lose money in the financial crash. I think it would be interesting to invest in things like wine. I saw a TV programme once. Wine goes up and up and up in price. You really can make a lot of money. I think investing in property nowadays is risky. I also know a lot of people who now owe lots of money on the house they bought because the prices crashed. Perhaps it’s better to keep my money under the bed."
