    "txt": "Job interviews are always hit and miss for me. Sometimes I have a great interview and get the job. Other times, my interview bombs and I don’t get the job. It’s really important to prepare. You must also be confident and make sure the interviewer knows you really want the job. The trick is to make the interviewer think you are the best person for the job. I always wear my best suit and arrive early. I always smile when I walk into the interview room. First impressions are very important. It’s also a good idea to talk about your experiences - sell yourself. Make sure you have a few good questions to ask at the end of the interview. Interview technique is something we learn over time – you get to relax more the more interviews you have."
