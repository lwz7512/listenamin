    "txt": "Everybody loves juice. It’s the yummiest thing in the world. I can’t think of anything tastier than a cold glass of any kind of juice. I have to have a glass of orange juice every morning. I like to spend a little extra to make sure it’s 100 per cent juice. I don’t really like the stuff that says it’s juice on the box, but is really 70 per cent water and sugar. Of course freshly squeezed juice is the best - you can really taste the fruit. One thing I love about going to another country is trying different kinds of juice. Tropical countries have all kinds of really delicious juice. One time I remember trying sugar cane juice. I was in heaven. It’s a shame I can’t buy it where I live. I also love coconut juice, or is that coconut milk?"
