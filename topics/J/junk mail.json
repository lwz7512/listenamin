    "txt": "I hate junk mail. I’m sick and tired of it filling up my InBox. I mean, who believes the stuff written in it? I love the ones that start with “Dearest” and then tell you how their uncle died during some war and they need your help to transfer $18 million. I wonder how many people fall for those. My spam mail filters do a pretty good job at keeping junk mail away from my InBox. But, I occasionally get a mail trying to sell me medicine. The most dangerous kind of junk mail is called phishing. That’s when a criminal fakes an e-mail to make it look like it’s sent from a bank. It looks exactly the same as a bank’s mail. The mail asks you to reset your password. The criminal then takes your money."
