    "txt": "If you think about it, kissing is strange. I mean, here we are in the twenty-first century and we still like kissing. I think we’re the only species on Earth that does this. Of course, there are different kinds of kissing. Kissing your parents or friends as a greeting is normal enough. That’s just like a friendly handshake. Passionate kissing is different. I’m not complaining though. I think kissing is great. I remember my first kiss. It was very exciting. I was nervous though because I kept thinking if I was doing it right. Some people say there is an art to kissing. I’m not so sure. If you love someone enough, you’ll be artistic enough. One thing I don’t like about kissing is people who do it next to you on the train or bus. Yuck!"
