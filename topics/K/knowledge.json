    "txt": "I really want to have more knowledge. My general knowledge is pretty good but I want it to be better. When I was a kid, I loved quiz programmes on the television. I used to read lots of encyclopedias to build up my knowledge. I now know most of the world’s capitals and which animals and birds are the fastest, and how many bones there are in the human body, etc. I love watching the news and this helps me get more knowledge. Even though I think I know quite a lot, I always meet people who are really knowledgeable. It seems some people know everything about everything. They are just like walking encyclopedias. I wonder if they’re happy with the amount of knowledge they have inside their brain."
