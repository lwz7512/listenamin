Of course if there was no language, we wouldn’t be able to use body language or sign language. The fact that we do have languages means we have gone to the moon and built things like the Internet – which also needs a special computer language to work properly. I think language is amazing. It means we can tell anyone anything. I often think it’s a shame there are so many languages in the world. If there was only one language, we could all communicate better. Perhaps that way, we’d all understand one another better. What would the world language be? At the moment, English."
