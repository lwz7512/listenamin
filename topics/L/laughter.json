    "txt": "Laughter is what makes the world go round. If you can’t laugh, life would be very boring and depressing. The sound of laughter is one of the most beautiful sounds in the world. Just hearing it makes me smile and want to laugh too. I have to find out what’s funny so I can share the joke, or share the fun. I particularly love the sound of small children laughing. Their laughter is infectious. It’s amazing the things they find to laugh about. I think I heard somewhere that laughter is the best medicine. That’s so true. I also think a good laugh keeps you healthy. A few people I know belong to a laughter club. They stand around in circles and laugh. Yes, laughter really is one of the best things we do."
