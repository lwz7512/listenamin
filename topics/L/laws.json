    "txt": "Without laws the world would end. OK, maybe the actual Earth might not end, but life as we know it would end. We’d all end up fighting and killing each other. It would become the survival of the strongest, or perhaps the survival of the nastiest. If there were no laws, people could do anything. There’d be no police or courts to keep control. Law is very important. It keeps order in our society. Our laws started thousands of years ago. Many of today’s laws were made centuries ago. New laws need to be made every day. Especially in today’s world, where the Internet is so important. It’s very difficult to keep laws up to date with new developments. The latest area of law is intellectual property. It’s important that people’s ideas are protected."
