    "txt": "Leadership is a word we hear a lot nowadays. Every time we turn on the news we hear about how important leadership is. Especially strong leadership. American presidents often talk about the importance of leadership. I suppose they’re right. It’s important that someone takes responsibility and shows leadership. With the right leaders, we can achieve success. But not every leader shows leadership. In many countries around the world, there are corrupt leaders. They do not have good leadership skills, they simply control people by fear. Good leadership is being respected by everyone and getting the job done. It’s important to have good leadership in companies too, except many of the banks’ leaders have not shown such good leadership."
