This is when we first start learning a language. Our ears get used to the different patterns of intonation. Learning is a lifelong process. We spend our childhood years doing nothing but learning. We learn a language before we are two. We learn how to play and do all the everyday things people do. Most people think learning only begins at school. I’m not sure about this. Are we really learning, or are we just memorizing things? I think a lot of learning happens outside school. We learn more from our hobbies and interests than what we learn from school books."
