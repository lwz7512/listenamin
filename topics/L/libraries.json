    "txt": "Libraries are wonderful places. Every library I’ve been to in the world is the same. They all have a special atmosphere. A room with a large collection of books does things to people. We become very quiet and want to know what’s on the shelves. This happens even to children as young as three, although perhaps not the being quiet. It’s amazing to watch a small child in a library looking at all the books. They can sit there for hours pulling the books off the shelves. I really spent a lot of time in the library at university. It was where I spent most of my time.  This is where I really learnt how useful libraries are. I spent hours every day looking at journals, newspapers and text books. I felt quite happy sitting in the quiet of the library, reading my books."
