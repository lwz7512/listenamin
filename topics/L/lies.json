Some people are better liars than others. In fact, I often read lying is an art. Children are pretty good at lying. Or perhaps they’re pretty bad, because it’s easy to tell when a child is lying. I read that the more lies children tell, the more intelligent they are. You need to be creative and imaginative to lie. There comes a stage in our lives when most of us stop lying. We are all told that it’s always better to tell the truth. Not all of us do this though. There are many very intelligent people who lie. We even trust them to run our country. I’ve lost count of the number of politicians who have been caught lying."
