    "txt": "Life is for living. That’s what I believe. It sounds very simple, but actually, it’s quite difficult. You only have one life, so you really have to live it. Don’t waste time doing boring things. Live life for today. Is living working in an office all your life? No. Take some risks in life. Invest in your life and do the things you really want to do. If you don’t try and live your dreams, you don’t really live. I often hear people saying to other, “get a life”. I agree with them. Don’t wait and let life pass you by. Life is too short and you can’t go back. I have a full life. I don’t live life in the fast lane, but I do make sure I do things so that when I look back on my life, I won’t have any regrets."
