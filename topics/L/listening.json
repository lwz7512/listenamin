    "txt": "Listening is the easiest English skill for me. I can understand about half of what people say to me. This means I can guess the things I don’t understand. Listening to the English of my American friends is not so difficult. I have problems when I try and understand the news on television. I also find movies hard to follow. I need the subtitles at the bottom of the screen. I think listening to songs in English made my listening better. It’s a lot more interesting than my listening CDs. I have one piece of advice for students who want to improve their listening. That is to listen to the same thing again and again. You understand more every time you listen. What’s your advice?"
