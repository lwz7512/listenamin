    "txt": "Literature is one thing that makes me very happy. I have loved books of all kinds since I was very small. I don’t know what I would do in life without novels, poems and plays. It’s amazing how literature can change your life. It educates you, makes you happy, makes you sad, inspires you and so much more. I think I’d be a completely different person without it. Literature has been a big influence on my life – perhaps as much as my friends. I think literature is really powerful. It can help us understand other cultures. Recently, I have read a lot of Indian literature, in English, of course. The books I read have totally changed my image of India and Indians. My experience has really made me want to read more books from other countries."
