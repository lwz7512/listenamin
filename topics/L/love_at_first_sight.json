    "txt": "Love is a wonderful thing, but is it possible to fall in love with someone at first sight? Many people say they have done this. How can it be possible? Surely it takes a time to get to know someone and then fall in love. I think falling in love at first sight is dangerous. You don’t really know the person. Maybe after you’ve built your life around them you’ll find lots of faults in them and suddenly be disappointed. Then you’ll have to fall out of love. Anyway, is it really love at first sight or is it love at first conversation? And what if the other person doesn’t fall in love with you at first sight? This could be a bit painful. It could also be embarrassing. I think I like the traditional way of falling in love after 257 dates."
