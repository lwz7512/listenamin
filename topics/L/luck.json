    "txt": "I often wonder how important luck is in my life. I’m not sure if there is a thing called luck. Some people say they are lucky and others say they are unlucky. I think everyone in life has good luck and bad luck. Just because someone loses something or has an accident doesn’t mean it’s bad luck. An accident is an accident. People who always say they have bad luck are negative. If they wait, something good will happen in their lives. I do like to wish people good luck though. I think it’s a nice thing to say if someone has an interview or an exam. But, people pass exams and interviews because they studied hard or spoke well, not because of luck. In England people think they’ll have seven years of bad luck if they break a mirror. That’s strange."
