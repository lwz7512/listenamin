    "txt": "There are magazines on just about anything you can think of. Just walk into a big bookstore and see the hundreds of different kinds of magazines. There are magazines for men, magazines for women, for children, for bankers, stamp collectors and even English students. They’re quite amazing when you think about it. There’s so much information in them. It must take a long time to make one magazine. And they are such great value for money. I like reading magazines that I would never usually buy. This happens when I’m in a waiting room. I like flicking through the magazine rack and looking through the magazine. I don’t care if it’s in another language. The pictures are interesting."
