    "txt": "Management is a funny thing. Most of the people I know who are in management are not actually managers. I mean, they don’t have any qualifications to say they are managers. I think most managers are like that. They spend a year or two in a job and then become managers once the old manager moves on. I’m not sure whether or not you can learn management. Of course there are things like MBAs that teach you this, but in the end, management is all about how you deal with people. If you have a personality that can’t respect people and treat them fairly, you can’t be a good manager.  I have worked for some terrible managers. They have no idea what they’re doing and only create lots of work for others."
