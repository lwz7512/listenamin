    "txt": "I’m full of admiration for people who run marathons. I couldn’t do it. I love running and have done a few half-marathons, but I always found a full marathon to be too much. Marathon runners are special. I don’t think I have the stamina to do it. Not properly, anyway. I could “run” one of the big marathons in the world, like the Boston or London marathon, but it would really be pretty much as a fun run. Most people who take part in these well-known international marathons only do so for fun. I think to be a marathon runner, you need to train and run a hundred kilometres a week. I wonder what it’s like to be in the lead in the Olympic marathon. That must be an amazing feeling. I think the marathon is the most important Olympic event."
