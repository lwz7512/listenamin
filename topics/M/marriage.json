    "txt": "Marriage seems to be a dying institution. Everywhere we look, there are more and more statistics saying marriage is on its way out, divorce is on the increase, or people are leaving it later and later to tie the knot. A worrying trend over the past few decades is the number of people who live together without making the commitment of marriage. I’m not really sure what the difference is. If you love someone and want to stay together forever, why not get married? I think marriage adds a lot to a couple’s life, from the wedding day itself, right through to all of the anniversaries. Unmarried people miss out on these special occasions. Marriage is also important if you want to start a family. Perhaps I’m just old-fashioned."
