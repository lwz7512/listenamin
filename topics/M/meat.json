    "txt": "I’m a big meat-eater. I love meat of all kinds. I have eaten all sorts of meat. Even though I love meat, I could easily stop eating it, and I don’t think I’d miss it. A long time ago I heard the vegetarian slogan “Meat is Murder”. If you think about it, that’s true. I don’t think animals are here today for us to eat, especially when we don’t need to eat meat. And then there’s the threat of global warming today. Raising animals needs land. Many forests are cut down to raise cows for meat. This really has to stop. Instead of meat, there are other things we could have. Dairy products would give us the protein we need. I know a lot of people who could never give up meat. They always say it would be impossible to go without a big, juicy steak."
