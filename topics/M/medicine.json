I’m not sure whether or not medicine is a good thing. I’m sure that most of the time our body will recover naturally, without medicine. I actually think medicine can be bad for us. It makes the body weaker because we rely on medicines too much. I also worry about the safety of medicines. I read too many times about side effects. How can doctors be sure that the medicines we take one day won’t make us ill later in life. A lot of what goes into medicine isn’t natural. I’m a big believer in natural medicine. That seems to make much more sense. The Chinese seem to have it right."
