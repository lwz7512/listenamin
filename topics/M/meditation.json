    "txt": "Meditation is one thing I’d really like to be able to do. I can’t do it. I have tried many times but nothing seems to happen. I have read a lot about meditation and it sounds really good. You can relax anytime you want. Twenty minutes of meditation is the same as three hours’ sleep. I love the idea of meditating for twenty minutes in my lunch time and then feeling totally refreshed. Meditation is also a good way of relieving stress. The thing I most like about meditation is that it makes you calm. All the people I know who meditate are always relaxed and easygoing. They never worry about anything. I think we should learn how to meditate at school. That would probably solve a lot of problems in society."
