    "txt": "Are men really from another planet? A lot of women think so. There are a lot of books about how strange men are. This is rubbish. Men are men, the same as women are women. Of course men are not perfect, no one is. Men actually have done a lot of bad things in the world. All of the wars in history were started and fought by men. They seem to be naturally aggressive and wanting to fight rather than talk. Things are changing though. There was the “1980s man”. Suddenly, men were more human. They helped with the shopping, cooked and did the washing up, and they even cried. We do need men. They are better at reading maps than women and men’s sports are more exciting than women’s sports."
