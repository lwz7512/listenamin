    "txt": "I sometimes worry about my mental health. There are times when I think I’m going crazy. I think it’s because of this world we live in. Everything is so fast. Everyone is in a hurry. Everything has to be done yesterday. I’m sure life wasn’t so stressful a hundred years ago. Then, people’s mental health was probably better. The only good thing nowadays is that there are mental health specialists who can help us when we are in trouble. But, there is a problem with these experts. They keep on thinking up new mental health problems we suffer from. What we all need is to take a step back and slow down. That will be good for our mental health. We need to laugh more and care more. If we don’t do this, we’ll all have mental health problems."
