    "txt": "What would life be like without Microsoft? Impossible? Perhaps not impossible, but definitely difficult. Microsoft seems to be a big part of our lives today. Most of us use Microsoft products every day. We need MS Word to create documents and Excel to make spreadsheets. At school we have to make PowerPoint presentations. Perhaps the biggest thing we use Microsoft for is getting on the Internet. Most of the world’s computers use the Explorer browser to connect to the Web. Millions of us use Hotmail to send e-mails. Millions more play games using Microsoft’s X-Box. In the future, there’ll probably be a lot more Microsoft stuff that helps us in our life. And to think, Microsoft didn’t even exist a few decades ago."
