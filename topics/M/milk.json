    "txt": "Milk is one of the best things we can eat or drink for our body. It’s so full of goodness and it tastes pretty good too. Milk is rich in calcium, which makes our bones and teeth strong. This makes milk essential for babies and growing children. It makes them grow up stronger. Milk is also full of many important vitamins and minerals. When I was little, I didn’t really like milk. I think I had a bad experience with sour milk, which turned me off of it. I remember drinking it again when I was a teenager and liking it. Now I think it’s one of the most refreshing drinks you can drink. Just looking at its whiteness makes me feel healthy. I like all kinds of milk, including goat’s milk and even camel’s milk. It’s all good for us."
