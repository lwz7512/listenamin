    "txt": "How important to you is your mobile phone? Do you really need it? In the 1980s there were no mobile phones. People still managed to phone their family and friends and do business. Of course, there were more public telephones then. There was a telephone box pretty much on every street corner. I wonder whether mobile phones are a good or bad thing. For sure, they are very convenient, but they can also be a nuisance. There’s nothing worse than talking to someone and then they ignore you for ten minutes while they answer their phone. I have even seen people on a date and one person chats on the phone for 30 minutes. How would life change for you if you didn’t have a mobile? Would you miss listening to other people’s conversations on the train?"
