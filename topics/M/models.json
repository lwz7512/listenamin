I’m sure this affects them in some way. They constantly think about their beauty and their figure. Male models too. A lot of female models also have to be very strict with what they eat so they don’t put on weight. Today, a model has to be size zero to be successful. This is unhealthy. The sad thing is that many normal girls want to look like a model so they end up having health problems. I suppose the life of a model is glamorous. The supermodels fly all over the world. They walk the catwalks at fashion shows and visit exotic locations for photo shoots. And get paid big money."
