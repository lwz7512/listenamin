    "txt": "Are you happy with your lifestyle? What kind of lifestyle do you lead? It seems that we think about our lifestyle more and more these days. Every time we turn on the TV or open a magazine, there is an ad, programme or article about this lifestyle or that lifestyle. We are told about healthy lifestyles, modern lifestyles, alternative lifestyles. Magazines use pages and pages and pages to describe the lifestyles of the rich and famous. I get the impression that few people are happy with their lifestyle. Most people are jealous of other people who have a “better” lifestyle. Those people should stop for a minute and think about the poor people in the world, or those caught up in wars. Those people don’t worry about lifestyles; they just worry about life."
