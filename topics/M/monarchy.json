    "txt": "Do we really need a monarchy in the 21st Century? It’s such a strange idea. It certainly is not a democratic idea. No one votes for someone to be king or queen. When a prince or princess is born, he or she automatically has a wonderful life. This is not fair. I had to study and work very hard just to get an average job, with not much money. Those in a monarchy are born into wealth. They never really have to lift a finger. The strange thing is that most people who live in a monarchy like their king and queen. Take the United Kingdom, for example. Around 80 per cent of British people support  their monarchy. I suppose it’s good for tourism. I wouldn’t say no to being part of a royal family."
