    "txt": "The Moon is a very mysterious thing. It has fascinated us for thousands of years. It is mentioned everywhere in science and literature almost from the time humans started writing. And today, it still fills us with wonder. The most amazing thing about the Moon is that humans have been there. Neil Armstrong walking on the Moon’s surface must be the greatest human achievement ever. Even though man has walked on the Moon, not everyone agrees on its colour. In Japan, and perhaps in other countries too, they think it’s yellow. Of course, the Moon is white. One day, we’ll probably have holidays on the Moon. I’d totally love that. Imagine staying in a Moon hotel and waking up in the morning to look at the Earth."
