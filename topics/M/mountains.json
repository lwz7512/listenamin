    "txt": "I love mountains. I much prefer them to every other kind of natural feature. They are much better than the sea, beaches, deserts, etc. Mountains are so cool. They rise up so high into the sky. I can’t stop looking at mountains, wherever I am in the world. I also love being in the mountains. The landscape is just spectacular. You really feel part of God’s wonderful creation when you are surrounded by mountains. There are so many things you can do in the mountains. Some people like climbing them or jumping off them with a parachute. This is not for me. I just like going for a walk and having a picnic. There’s nothing better than sitting down and admiring the mountain view and feeling the cool mountain breeze. This is paradise."
