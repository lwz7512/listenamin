    "txt": "I love watching movies. At the cinema, on TV or on my computer. I'm a big movie fan and love all the news of my favourite movie stars. I like all kinds of movies - Hollywood blockbusters, black and white movies from the 50s, independent movies... They're all good. Recently I've got into watching foreign movies. I like the films that come out of Bollywood - they're very different. The first film I saw at the movie theatre was Star Wars. I was amazed at the special effects. Nowadays, so many movies have such good computer graphics that we forget how special the effects are. One of my favourite ways of relaxing is to rent the latest DVD and sit on the sofa with a big bag of potato chips. The sound has to be up to the max and the lights have to be off."
