When I was a teenager, I had a record collection. You had to go to a store and buy your music. I had hundreds of records. The first time I came across mp3s I laughed. I was totally amazed. I still find it hard to believe I can keep 10,000 songs in my pocket and take them anywhere in the world. I also love the idea of mp3 downloads. It’s much easier than going to a record store. I’m wondering what happens after mp3s. What’s next? I’m sure one day people will laugh at how “old technology” mp3s are."
