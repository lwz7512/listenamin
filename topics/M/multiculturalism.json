    "txt": "Multiculturalism is everywhere today. As the world gets smaller, multiculturalism becomes bigger. Few of us today live in towns in which there is only one culture. Today, we live in towns where we are surrounded by many other cultures. If we live in a city, we will see people from all over the world. Of course, some cities are more multicultural than others. New York is a real melting pot. It is called the most multicultural city on Earth. A city like Tokyo isn’t so multicultural. I think multiculturalism is a great thing. It’s fantastic walking out of your door and seeing other cultures. This didn’t happen when I was young. People didn’t understand other cultures. They didn’t even want to understand. I’m glad things are changing today."
