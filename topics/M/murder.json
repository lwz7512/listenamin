    "txt": "Murder is the most evil thing in the world. I don’t know how it is possible for one person to murder another. Why do they think they can take someone else’s life? Even worse are people who commit multi-murder. Mass killing seems to be more and more common today. Shootings at schools are especially bad. How can we prevent murder? Every time we look at the news, there’s another murder. I hope it is not something that will stay with the human race forever.  What is the correct punishment for murder? In some societies it is just a few years in prison. In others it is the death penalty. But there are some countries that don’t punish people for murder. If you are in power and are rich, you can literally get away with murder."
