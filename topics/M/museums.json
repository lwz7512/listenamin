They educate us, they preserve our history, they show us how we have developed. There are museums on so many different things. In fact, I’m sure there isn’t a topic there isn’t a museum for. I’ve loved museums since I was little. We used to go to different museums on school trips. I loved them. I saw so many amazing things. I will never forget seeing the bones of a T-Rex in the natural history museum. I also remember staring at Tutankhamen’s gold mask for ages. I couldn’t take my eyes off of it. The best museum I’ve ever been to is the National Museum in Cairo. It’s unbeatable."
