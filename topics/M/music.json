I also wonder when we first become interested in music. Is it when we are a baby? Some people think our interest in music starts before we are born. Music is an essential part of my day. It changes my feeling and puts me in a good mood. There’s nothing better to do on a train or bus than put on my headphones. I like all kinds of music, from classical and opera to jazz, rock and world music. I’m always looking for something new. Sometimes I hear a song or piece of music on the TV or radio. I have to find out who it is. Do you do that? I’m sure I’ll keep collecting CDs or mp3s until I’m a hundred. Perhaps I won’t be able to hear it then!"
