    "txt": "I really wish I could play a musical instrument. I can’t. I had a few music lessons when I was a kid, but I didn’t keep them up. I really regret that now. I get quite jealous of people who can play a musical instrument. It’s a wonderful ability. I hope they know how lucky they are to be able to play an instrument. Of all the musical instruments, I’d like to play the piano. I think this is the king of musical instruments. It sounds so beautiful. Pianos also look beautiful. I imagine it’s very relaxing playing it. Another instrument I’d like to play is the guitar. I still want to be a rock star, although I’m a bit old now. I suppose it’s never too old though to learn to play something. I haven’t given up hope."
