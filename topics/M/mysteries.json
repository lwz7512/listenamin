    "txt": "Life is full of mysteries. The world is full of mystery. In fact, both life and the world are mysteries. How exactly did we get here? The natural world is full of mystery. We have unlocked many of nature’s secrets, but there are many things we still don’t know. There are some mysteries that people don’t believe in. Is there really a Loch Ness Monster or a Yeti? Do ghosts and the supernatural really exist? Perhaps the biggest mystery of all is whether aliens exist. Scientists have spent billions of dollars working on this. I find people here on Earth to be a mystery. I can never understand why people behave the way they do. Even the people close to me can be the biggest mysteries. That’s strange, isn’t it?"
