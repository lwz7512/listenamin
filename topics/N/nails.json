    "txt": "Nails are funny things. Why do we have them? I actually find them quite annoying. We have to keep cutting them, they get dirty, and sometimes they break and become painful. I’d rather we didn’t have nails. I’m sure it wouldn’t change our lives. I guess women would say no to that idea. My female friends spend a lot of money on their nails. I don’t know why. Nail polish stinks, and so does nail polish remover. I really don’t know why they waste their time going for manicures. It must be really boring sitting there, watching someone paint your nails. Nail art is now big business. People have become millionaires opening nail art salons. The best thing for me would be to have really short nails that never grow."
