    "txt": "I like my names. I have four names – my family name, my given name and two middle names. I’m not sure why I have two middle names. I guess my parents wanted to name me after two of my uncles. Names are different all over the world. In some countries, family name comes before the given name. In the Muslim world, a girl’s name includes her father and grandfathers’ names. In Japan and China, there is no middle name. I think it’s interesting how people choose a name. I really don’t understand naming a baby after a famous actor or sports star. That’s silly. I think names should have a meaning. In the West, people don’t really know what their name means. In many countries, each name has a special meaning."
