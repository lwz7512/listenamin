    "txt": "Some national anthems are really good and some aren’t. I like my country’s anthem. It makes me feel proud of my country every time I hear it. I’m a little embarrassed to say I don’t know the words to it. In some countries, they play the national anthem every day in school. I remember being in Thailand. They play the national anthem in the streets every morning. Everyone stops and stands still. When the anthem finishes, people start walking again. In other countries I’ve been to, they play the national anthem in cinemas before a movie starts. I really like hearing my national anthem played at the Olympics. That means my country won a gold medal. I have to hold back the tears when I hear it then."
