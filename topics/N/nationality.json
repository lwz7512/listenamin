    "txt": "Nationality is a strange thing. I don’t think it used to be. Nowadays, with globalization, people want to change their nationality. Many people from poor countries want to go to rich countries and become citizens. It’s strange because I don’t understand how your nationality can change. Even if I live in Peru for 50 years, I’m still English, even though I might have a Peruvian passport. I think people have confused feelings when they change nationalities. Their heart is still in their real country and not in the country of their new nationality. Nationality unfairly decides how successful you’ll be in life. If you’re born in a rich country, you’ll get a good education. If you’re born in a poor country, you might not even get basic human rights."
