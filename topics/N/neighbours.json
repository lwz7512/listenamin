    "txt": "Neighbours are very hit and miss. Sometimes you hit the jackpot and get neighbours who become great friends. Other times you get the short straw and have nightmare neighbours. I’ve had good and bad neighbours. I’m not sure why some neighbours are so bad. It’s really not that difficult to be a good neighbour. All you have to do is be polite, don’t play loud music late at night, and don’t park in front of their house. It sounds easier than it is. I think a long time ago there was a lot of neighbourliness. Families lived near each other for generations. It’s different today. New families come and go. They never get to know each other. Everyone keeps their distance. This is not always a good thing."
