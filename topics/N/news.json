They really don’t have to bring us such terrible stories. I looked at the news last night. There was news about two wars, a corrupt leader, an increase in knife crime, and the story of a deadly new disease. Oh, I forgot, and the global financial crisis. We’re all poorer and will stay poorer for the next twenty years! I’m sure there must be something happy to tell us. If we look at nice news stories, we’ll all feel happier. We need news about the good humans are doing. I want to hear about advances in medicine and science, or about someone raising a million dollars for a charity."
