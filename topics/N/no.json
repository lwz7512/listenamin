    "txt": "Sometimes I like the word ‘no’, and sometimes I hate it. It is a very powerful word, even though it has just two letters. I don’t like the word ‘no’ when I have been for a job interview and didn’t get the job. I also hate this word when I ask someone on a date. Then, hearing ‘no’ is like a kick in the teeth. I think I probably say ‘yes’ more than ‘no’. I love going out. I never say ‘no’  if anyone asks me to go to a club or go on a trip. I wonder how many ways there are of saying ‘no’. Sometimes you can say ‘no’ when you really mean ‘yes’. Other times, ‘no’ means ‘no’. I also like this small word because it fits into some interesting phrases, like ‘no-can-do,’ a ‘no-go area’ and ‘no way Jose’. My favourite is ‘that’s a real no-no’ – for things you must never do."
