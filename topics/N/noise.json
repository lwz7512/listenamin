I really want to have a button to turn it off. It’s amazing how much noise there is around us. We usually never even think about it. Listen now to the noise around you. Cars, computers, music, people talking. It’s strange to think that in the past few decades, people have been talking about noise pollution. That’s a really good description. Noise is quite often pollution. It’s stuff that makes our surroundings unpleasant. I wonder if there is any kind of noise that is good noise. The very word ‘noise’ has a negative meaning. But if you say sound, it has a different meaning. I love the sound of babies laughing."
