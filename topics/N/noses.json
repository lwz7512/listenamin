    "txt": "Our nose is the strangest of all body parts. It’s such a funny thing. And where is it? Right on the front of our face. Right in the middle. It would be OK if everyone had exactly the same nose. But we all have a different nose. Some of us have a big nose, some a small nose. Some of us have a crooked nose with big nostrils. My nose is one part of my body I’d really like to change. It’s too big for the size of my face. When people talk about why other people are beautiful or handsome, no one says, “because he or she has a nice nose,” or “oooh, his (or her) nose is just soooo sexy”. I suppose if you really don’t like your nose, you can have a nose job. Unfortunately, not all of us can afford cosmetic surgery."
