    "txt": "Many scientists say nuclear energy is our future. Many normal people aren’t so sure. I think most of us worry about nuclear energy. We hear on the news about the dangers of nuclear power. Many years ago there was a big accident in Chernobyl, Russia. A nuclear reactor caught fire and melted. Because of this, deadly radiation spread across the whole of Europe. There were reports that sheep in England caught radiation sickness. I think things are safer now. Many countries trust nuclear energy. France and Japan each has dozens of nuclear power stations. I think it’s probably a good idea. We really need to stop using fossil fuels. Nuclear power is a lot less harmful to the environment. Perhaps we need to spend more money on making it safer."
