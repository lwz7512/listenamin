    "txt": "Nuclear weapons are the worst thing invented by man. The day we invented them was a black day in our history. Fortunately, they have only been used a few times. We only need to read the history of what happened in Japan to understand why nuclear weapons must never be used again. The Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were destroyed in an instant. Hundreds of thousands died. Today, nuclear weapons are a hundred times more powerful. It’s scary to think how much harm one nuclear bomb could cause. Even scarier, is what happens if terrorists get hold of nuclear weapons. I fear for our future. One day, all countries will have nuclear weapons and then we’ll be in real trouble."
