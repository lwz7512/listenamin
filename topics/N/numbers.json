    "txt": "A Just stop and think how important numbers are to our lives. Numbers control us. In fact, we are numbers. We have passport numbers, social security numbers, ID numbers, and more. We live in a house and a street that has a number. We communicate with each other using telephone numbers. We worry about how small or big the numbers are on our bank statements. We can’t survive without numbers. Most of the world cannot function without the numbers zero and one. These are the two numbers computers use to run their programmes. I don’t think numbers were always so important. Maybe 500 years ago, we only had to remember the number of sheep, goats or children we had. I wonder how many numbers we need today!"
