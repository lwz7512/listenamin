    "txt": "Nursing is one of the greatest professions in the world. It’s so much more important than most jobs. The sad thing is that nurses get paid so little. They do such a valuable job but get paid less than politicians. This is not right. Politicians do whatever they can to take our money. They even vote to stop nurses getting increases in pay. This is wrong. Governments need to do more to help nurses. There should be a bigger focus on the profession. I would much rather have more nurses than more weapons. A few years ago I wanted to get into nursing. I met some nurses who told me not to. They said the job involved too many hours, too much paperwork and not enough pay. That’s sad. We can’t afford to treat nurses so badly."
