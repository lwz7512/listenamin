Every day we hear stories about the rainforests and the ice caps, but we rarely hear about the oceans. They form most of the Earth’s surface and most of the world’s species live in them. They are responsible for weather patterns and a lot of the world’s foods. The problem is, they are becoming very polluted. Many fish species are in danger of dying. The coral reefs in our oceans are also in danger. We really need to think more about our oceans. We have to protect the life in them, or we might die. I love the ocean. I love the sound, the smell, the colour. I feel so happy and relaxed just looking at the ocean."
