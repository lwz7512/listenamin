    "txt": "Oil is good and bad. It’s good because it helps our energy needs. It’s bad because it causes pollution. Oil is a fossil fuel. Burning it produces carbon dioxide (CO2). This is one of the biggest causes of global warming. There isn’t much oil left in the ground. Some people say it will all be gone this century. I suppose that means we won’t make as much pollution. But what will we do when the oil runs out? Scientists are working on that right now. We need to do something because we use oil to power our cars, homes and factories. Whatever we replace oil with must be better for the environment. I don’t think oil-producing countries are happy their oil will run out. They need to start thinking about how to make money after the oil has gone."
