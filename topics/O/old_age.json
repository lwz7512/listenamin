    "txt": "I’m a bit worried about my old age. I don’t really want to get old. I like being young. On the other hand, if I do get old, I want to live to be over 100. I’m hoping old age will be nice. It seems a time when you can relax and slow down. If course, you have to slow down because your body wears out. There are two things I’m worried about. One is money. I think if you are old and poor, you’ll be miserable. No money to enjoy yourself. Maybe not even enough money to eat, pay bills or go to the hospital. That’s scary. The other thing I worry about is being in good health. Especially my mental health. I imagine I’ll be happy in my old age. I have so many hobbies and I know I’ll enjoy doing them all every day."
