Anyway, the Olympics really is a celebration of humanity. The whole world watches and gets excited. We love watching our heroes trying to win gold. I don’t usually get excited about seeing my country’s flag, but at the Olympics, I love it. I think the Olympics were better many years ago. Then, they had traditional Olympic sports. Nowadays we have professional tennis and baseball stars playing in sports that aren’t really Olympic sports. I would love to see an Olympic games. Maybe I’ll be lucky and get a chance to see the London games in 2012."
