    "txt": "Operations are amazing things – unless, that is, you’re having one. I always think it is incredible how doctors can cut people open and repair their body. It must take great skill. I can’t believe some operations can take over 12 hours. I’ve had a few operations in my life. I have very mixed feelings about them. My worst fear is that I’ll die. My biggest hope is that the operation will be successful and I’ll make a full recovery. I also think about how interesting it is. I like watching all the things the doctors and nurses do before the operation. I’m really nervous, but it’s like being in the middle of a TV documentary. I once had an operation and I was awake for the whole thing. I could see lots, but I won’t go any further."
