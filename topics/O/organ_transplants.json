    "txt": "The question of organ transplants is a difficult one. Not for me though. I’m quite happy to donate all of my organs for transplants. I don’t mind my body being donated to science after I die. I think it’s much better to be useful even after I die. I would be so happy to know that my heart was used to save someone else’s life. I don’t need my eyes after I die, so it’d be great if someone else could use them to see. Even though I want my body to be used for medical science, it feels a little strange to think that medical students will be cutting me up. I know in other parts of the world there are many people who don’t like the idea of organ transplants. They believe the body should stay in one piece. I hope that changes because doctors really need the organs."
