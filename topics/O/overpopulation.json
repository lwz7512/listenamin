    "txt": "Overpopulation is a real problem. It could kill the Earth. Very soon, there will be too many people and not enough land. There won’t be enough farms to grow food for everyone. We’ll eat all of the fish in the sea. And our pollution will cause more global warming. I think we are in a very serious situation. I don’t know what the answer is. Our leaders don’t seem too worried. They never see the bigger picture. The world’s population is exploding, and explosions cause great damage. More and more people are living longer and longer. We have better medicines. Our scientists have found cures to many diseases. There are many reasons. What we really need to do is think about how overpopulation is damaging the Earth."
