    "txt": "I like painting. It makes me very happy. I loved using paint when I was young. I was really good at drawing, even in elementary school. My school reports said I had a talent in art. I won the school painting competition many times. My friends say painting is difficult. I disagree. All you have to do is pick up a brush and put the paint on the paper. Anyone can do it. It’s child’s play. I don’t understand why people say they can’t paint. For me, it’s so easy to paint. It’s the most natural thing in the world to do. My friends say my paintings look so real, and that their paintings look like children’s paintings. I’m not sure why this is. I’m lucky, I guess. I don’t know what I would do without painting. It really helps me to relax."
