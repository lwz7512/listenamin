    "txt": "Are you a panic? I am sometimes, although I like to think I’m not. I panic when I’m really late for something important. Panicking in this situation is really no good. It won’t get me there any quicker. It will only make me look really panicked when I get there. I also panic if I think I’ve lost an important computer file. I don’t panic, though, in emergency situations. I think I’m good at staying calm and helping others. There have been a few times when people asked me how I could stay so cool. I guess everyone is different. Imagine what it’s like to be a soldier. Do they panic? Do police officers and fire-fighters panic? They always keep a cool head. A lot of people panicked recently in the financial crisis. Losing money always makes people panic."
