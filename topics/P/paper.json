    "txt": "I think paper is one of the best inventions ever. Without paper, we would all still be farmers. The discovery of paper was the start of the first information technology revolution. OK, it’s not very technological, but it did change our lives. We started to write down our history; we wrote down poems and books and plays. We also wrote our holy books on paper. Then, one day, many centuries ago, someone invented the printing press. Suddenly, people printed hundreds, thousands, millions of books. Society changed because more and more people could read. We became educated. We can’t live without paper today. Even though we have the Internet, we still love reading real newspapers; we still read real books; and we still write messages on paper."
