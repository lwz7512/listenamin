    "txt": "Being a parent is the biggest responsibility we can have in our lives. It’s scary if you think about it. You have to look after a tiny baby for years and years. It is your duty to make sure that little baby grows up into a wonderful, happy and responsible human being. Parenting means knowing everything from day one. This is a shock to many parents. I didn’t have any parenting lessons. I suddenly had a baby to look after. But it’s not that scary. In fact, parenting is life’s biggest joy. I can’t put into words how wonderful it is to be a parent. My biggest worry is that society doesn’t focus on parenting. We really should have classes at school on being good parents. I’m sure we would reduce the number of problems in society if we did this."
