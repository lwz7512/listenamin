You meet people, eat delicious food, and have lots of fun. I’ve always loved parties. I remember the birthday parties I had as a child. Such wonderful memories. I also remember the first parties I went to as a teenager – all night parties where we danced and chatted until morning. I’ve lost count of the number of parties I’ve been to. Dinner parties, beach parties, New Year’s Eve parties, birthday parties… the list goes on. One party I’d really like to go to is the Queen’s garden party. Of course this is in England. If you go to this party, it means you’ve done something special in life. All I have to do now is think of something special to do!"
