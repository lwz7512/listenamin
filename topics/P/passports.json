    "txt": "Passports are interesting things. I wonder who decides their design. Who thinks up the words to put inside? They are also pretty simple things. A passport is really just a tiny book full of empty pages and some personal information and a photo. I’ve always thought it must be easy to make a fake passport. I’ve heard passports sell for a lot of money on the black market, especially American ones. Without a passport we can’t travel. Our passport makes it so easy for us to go anywhere. I love it when my passport gets old because it’s full of visas and entry and exit stamps. Passports were originally for ship passengers, a pass for the ports during a sea journey. Perhaps today they should be called something different."
