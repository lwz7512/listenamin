    "txt": "I love pasta of all kinds. Anything with pasta is always delicious, especially if it’s from Italy. For many countries, pasta is a new addition to the menu. In England just after the war, there was no pasta. Once, a newspaper tricked people with a photo of a spaghetti tree. Today, everyone in England knows about pasta. It’s one of the most popular foods in the world. Spaghetti Bolognese and lasagna are now international dishes. What I don’t know is how many different types of pasta there are. Hundreds, I think; in all different shapes and colours. What I do know is that they are all delicious. Pasta is very versatile because it has so many uses. You can also eat it when it’s hot or when it’s cold."
