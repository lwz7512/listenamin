    "txt": "People say patience is a virtue. I agree with this. Having patience is a good part of someone’s character. Not everyone has patience. These people get angry and frustrated quickly. They can’t wait. If you have no patience, you want everything to happen right now. Children often have little patience, especially when there’s a present to open. They get really impatient and want to open the gift immediately. We become more patient as we get older. Perhaps we learn how to be more patient. In today’s world, you really need patience because we expect everything to happen straight away and often it doesn’t. I’m quite patient. I need it for my job. I’m a teacher so you need to wait for people to answer and learn."
