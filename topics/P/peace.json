    "txt": "Peace is the one thing we all hope for in the world. I wonder if it will ever come. It seems so simple, really. Why can’t everyone live in peace? It seems a lot easier to do that than to fight useless wars. If there was peace in the world, everyone’s life would be better. Governments could spend all the money they waste on armies on education and healthcare. We really need peace. There have been too many wars in our history. I would say well over 99 percent of the world’s people want peace. Only a tiny minority doesn’t want peace, although they say they do. World leaders need to think more carefully about how they can achieve peace in the world."
