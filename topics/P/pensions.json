    "txt": "Do you have a pension? I didn’t have one for many years. I always thought it was strange to start saving in my twenties for life in my seventies. Now, I wish I had started my pension earlier. My pension would be much bigger. The pension my government will give me isn’t so big. It isn’t really enough to survive on. Nowadays people need to think carefully about their pension and how they will get by when they retire. I’m lucky because I live in a country where the government gives you some kind of pension. In many countries, you get nothing. I can’t believe the pensions some people get. When company CEOs retire, they get a multi-million-dollar pension. That doesn’t seem fair. They aren’t better than other people."
