    "txt": "“People are strange, when they are strangers.” That’s from a famous song. I do agree with it, although I do think all people are strange. It’s a good thing that people are strange. If we were all the same, life would be boring. It’s the fact that we are all strange that makes us all different. I like people from all over the world. It’s sad that all people don’t get along. Many people say I’m strange. I’m not sure why. I always think I’m pretty normal. The people I like best are those who help other people. They make the world a better place. The people I hate most are greedy people. They usually take the things other people need. All people need to think more about how they can help others."
