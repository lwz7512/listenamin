    "txt": "Who likes perfume? It stinks. It’s one of the worst smells in the world. I hate it when someone walks past me with really strong perfume or cologne. It makes me feel a little sick and I worry about the chemicals in it. Why do people need to wear so much perfume? What’s the point? I thought the original idea of perfume was to cover the smell of our bodies when we didn’t take a bath. Everybody showers or takes a bath these days, so there’s no need for perfume. It’s also a waste of money. How can a tiny bottle of strong-smelling water cost so much? I think the perfume companies are making huge amounts of money. I wonder how many people agree with me on this. What do you think of perfume? Is it OK for men and women?"
