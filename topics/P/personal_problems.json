    "txt": "One of my friends always seems to have personal problems. Sometimes it’s a relationship, sometimes it’s family, and sometimes it’s her. I’m not sure why she has so many personal problems and I think many of her problems aren’t really problems at all. She’s a bit of an attention seeker. I think she invents problems just so she can talk to people. She likes people to feel sorry for her. I think it’s amazing how many people talk about their personal problems on TV or on the radio. Who cares? There are much more important things happening in the world today than someone breaking up with their friend. If you think about all the terrible things happening in the world, our personal problems really aren’t problems at all."
