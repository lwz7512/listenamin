    "txt": "What kind of personality do you have? Do you ever think about your personality? I do. I think it’s very interesting to explore personality. My own personality has changed a lot over the years. When I was a child, I was painfully shy, but now I’m brimming with confidence. I have learned how to be with people and let my true character shine. The personalities of my friends have rubbed off on me, which I’m happy about. There are parts of my personality I’m not too happy with. I’m quick to get angry with people and sometimes I sulk when I don’t get my own way. I think overall I have a good personality. I’m easy to get on with and I’m quite happy and cheerful. I might take some personality tests and see what they say about me."
