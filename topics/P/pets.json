    "txt": "Everyone needs a pet. It’s really cool to look after an animal of some kind, or even a bird or insect. I’ve always had pets. When I grew up, we had three dogs, five cats, a tortoise and loads of rabbits. I lost count of the number of rabbits we had. Pets are really important for kids. Looking after a pet teaches the child responsibility. It’s cute looking at the way children play with their pets. They always seem to have so much fun. I wonder if pets like being pets. I think if I were a dog, it’d be a good life to be a pet. I get all my food given to me, I have somewhere warm and dry to sleep and I get to run and play lots. I suppose if you had a bad owner, that wouldn’t be good. One day I want an unusual pet like a tarantula or a scorpion."
