    "txt": "Everyone knows a lot about philosophy, even if they don’t know it. We are all philosophers because we all have views and opinions on life. We don’t all know about the philosophy that people study as a university subject. I know the names of Aristotle, Plato, Nietzsche and Freud, but I don’t really know what philosophy they spoke about. I also know Descarte’s famous quote “I think, therefore I am” but I can’t get too excited about it. I once read a book called “The Tao of Pooh”. It was the philosophy of life according to Winnie the Pooh. I liked reading that more than most philosophy books I’ve tried. My philosophy on life is to always try your best, help those around you, and to always be positive about everything."
