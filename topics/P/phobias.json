    "txt": "Phobias are interesting things. Some of them are very serious and can have a really negative influence on life. The most common phobias are the fear of open spaces or closed spaces and the fear of heights and flying. Doctors say all phobias are treatable. Phobias are irrational fears of something. There is no logical reason why someone is afraid of going outside or of flying. It’s all inside the sufferer’s head. I understand some phobias like the fear of flying, but not others. Some people are afraid of babies, or computers, and even of peanut butter sticking to the roof of your mouth. That phobia has a really long Latin name. I wonder if there’s a phobia about the English language. Perhaps that’s grammarphobia."
