    "txt": "Photography is one of the world’s best-loved hobbies. Recently, it seems as though everyone in the world has become a photographer. It’s so easy now to take good photographs. When I was a teenager, photography was one of my biggest hobbies. I loved taking photos of all kinds of things. I also had a lot of photographic equipment. I couldn’t wait to get my photos developed. Now there are digital cameras and phone cameras. Anyone can take really good photographs. What’s more, we can use all kinds of software to change our photos and display them online. I think photography will get easier and more interesting in the future. I still think great photographers will be like great artists."
