It’s as though physics is the key to unlocking all of our world’s mysteries. I really enjoyed studying physics at the beginning. It was interesting then. But then it got difficult and I couldn’t understand the formulae. I have a lot of respect for physicists. They seem to be able to understand lots of really difficult things. Without them, we would still be living very basic lives. Physicists have sent people to the Moon. Their research has led to all of our modern technology. I always read fewer and fewer students are choosing to study physics. This is a shame."
