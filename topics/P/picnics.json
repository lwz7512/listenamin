    "txt": "Everybody likes picnics. Going on a picnic seems to be a popular activity all over the world. Having a picnic makes everyone happy. There’s usually lots of delicious food and somewhere nice to eat it. I think it’s interesting to see the different things people take on picnics. In England, people take a picnic basket full of sandwiches and cake. In India, people take small metal containers of curry. In Japan, people take square boxes of food that are beautifully presented. I think it’s easy to tell where picnickers are from just from looking at what they bring to the picnic. The great thing about picnics is that they are outside and you can eat and feel the warm sun. I’ve never heard of picnics in the snow, although I guess they might happen somewhere."
