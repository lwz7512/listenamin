    "txt": "Pilots do very important jobs. They have the lives of all their passengers in their hands. I wanted to be a pilot when I was little. I thought it would be great to fly all over the world. I also liked the pilot’s uniform. I wasn’t so good at science so I dropped that idea. I think being an airline pilot is a unique job. It is quite glamorous, it is well paid, you travel and you are your own boss. There’s no one telling you what to do. The pilot just has to get his or her schedule and then fly to the next destination. And they get the best view from the cockpit. I think pilots see some amazingly beautiful things as they fly through the clouds and towards the rising sun. I wonder if pilots ever get fed up of flying."
