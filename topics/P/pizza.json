    "txt": "Everybody loves pizza. It must be the most popular food in the world. I don’t know anyone who doesn’t like it. I absolutely love pizza. I’ll eat any kind any time of the day or night. Hot pizza, cold pizza, pizza with pineapple, whatever. My favorite pizza is, of course, the traditional type made in Naples in Italy. Just the simple dough with nothing but cheese and tomato – it works for me every time. I remember the first pizza restaurant opening in my town. I was so happy. I tried out all the different toppings and switched between deep-pan crusty pizzas and those with a thin base. I love half-and-half pizzas – you get two tastes for the price of one. I also had all-you-can-eat pizza a few times. Not such a good idea if you worry about your weight."
