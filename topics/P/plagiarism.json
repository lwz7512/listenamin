    "txt": "OK everyone, today's topic is plagiarism. If you don't know what that is, it's copying stuff from books or the Internet without letting people know where the stuff came from. Lots of people do it nowadays because copy and paste is so quick and easy. It's OK to copy and paste small chunks of someone's work but you must make it clear it's copied, and write from whom you copied it or where you got it. Put the text in quotation marks and say something like, \"according toâ€¦\" and then put the writer's name. The best thing is to go to the Internet and search for, \"how to cite sources\". EnglishClub.com has good information on how to do this. The best thing is to make sure what you write is really from your head."
