    "txt": "How did all the planets get there? How is it only our planet has life? Will we ever travel to other planets? These are questions I often think about. I think our planet is the best. It looks so beautiful from space with its mixture of blue and green. The other planets look too strange to me. Mercury is just a red, hot ball, pretty much the same as Mars. Saturn looks like a real planet. Its rings give it an extra-special look. The other planets don’t look that interesting. I don’t really know much about Venus, Neptune, Uranus and Jupiter. When I was at school, we learnt that Pluto was a planet. But now it isn’t. Scientists have decided there are now only eight planets in our solar system and not nine. I wonder why they dropped Pluto."
