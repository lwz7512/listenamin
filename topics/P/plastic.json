There are all kinds of plastic. It’s pretty useful stuff. I once went to an exhibition on plastic. I was shocked to see just how important it is in our lives. Look around you and count how many things you see or have or are wearing that are made of plastic. One day, we’ll need to find a replacement for plastic. That’s because oil will run out and plastic is made from oil. Maybe in the future there’ll be plastic museums full of valuable plastic. People will buy antique plastic. I think I’ll save some pens and plastic carrier bags. They might be worth something in the future."
