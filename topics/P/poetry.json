    "txt": "Poetry is a very beautiful thing. I love reading it. It’s very clever. It’s like reading a painting. The poet paints beautiful scenes and images with just a few words. I think it’s amazing how the poet can change our feelings so simply, and can make us think with so few words. I like poems about nature and love best. When I read a poem about the countryside or the sea, I can actually see what the poet saw. When a poem is about love or other feelings, it makes me think more. I think people need to study and read poetry more. In some cultures, poetry is more popular than songs. I know that in many Arab countries, poets are superstars. One form of poetry that seems to be crossing cultures is Japanese haiku."
