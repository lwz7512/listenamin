    "txt": "What would society be like without the police? They do a very valuable job. Without them, our society would be less safe. The police are the people we call when we are in danger or something bad has happened. Even people who say they don’t like the police will call them for help. I think being a police officer is an interesting but risky job. Police officers must see lots of strange things every day. I guess there is never a boring day in a police officer’s life. I wanted to be a police officer once but decided it would be too dangerous. I didn’t want to be in the middle of a riot or chase people with guns. I think we must respect the police because they do a difficult job. It seems as though their job is getting more difficult."
