    "txt": "I often ask myself what politics is. When I turn on the television and see politicians in action, I think it looks like a circus. A lot of the politicians I see are like comedians. They lie, they steal money and get involved in all kinds of scandals. Politics should be about serving the people. This cannot happen when most of the people think most politicians can’t do their job properly. I’ve always found it strange that there are usually only two kinds of politics in most countries. You vote for the Democrats or Republicans, the left or the right. Some countries have a middle, but that’s still not a lot to vote for. I also think it’s strange that most politicians do not focus on what the people want. People want better health and education, not war."
