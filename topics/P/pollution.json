    "txt": "I hate pollution. It makes me really angry. I think pollution is greed. People don’t care about the environment so they pollute the air just to make lots of money. Big companies are the worst. They pretend they’re not polluting. They have the money to say they are “green”. Pollution affects us all. We are all less healthy because of companies that pollute the air or our rivers. Everybody needs to think about how we can reduce the amount of pollution we create. Not using the car when we can walk is one way. Turning off lights we don’t need is another. Barack Obama says he’s going to do his best to help the Earth. I really hope he does because if pollution gets any worse, we’ll be in seriously big trouble."
