    "txt": "Pornography seems to be part of every culture in the world. The Internet has greatly increased the amount of pornography in the world. A lot of pornographic sites on the Internet are really bad. I think pornography is a very difficult issue. I wonder why people need to buy pornographic magazines and videos. I suppose it’s human nature. Or perhaps I should say its “man nature” because most pornography is for men. One thing I find interesting about pornography is how some countries say it leads to sexual crimes and others say it reduces them. In my country, there aren’t many laws to control pornography. It’s very easy to buy adult magazines and videos. But I don’t buy any… or rent any… or download any."
