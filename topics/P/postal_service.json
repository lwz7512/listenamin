    "txt": "I wonder what will happen to the postal service. When I was young, I used the post office a lot. I went to the post office every week to buy stamps and send letters. I got excited every morning when the postman came. There was usually one letter for me – a real one. At Christmas and around my birthday I would get lots of cards. But today the post office is very different. I can’t remember the last time I went. I think the Internet is killing the post office. Most letters and mail sent today is via e-mail. I don’t even go to the post office to buy stamps. I get them from the local store. I’m not sure if the post office can survive, especially with competition from courier companies like Federal Express and DHL."
