I cannot count the number of different ways to cook a potato. Potatoes can be fried, baked, mashed, boiled, sauteed, and lots more. You can also eat potatoes hot or cold – I really like a chilled potato salad in the summer. Different countries cook potatoes in different ways too. Indian cooking is great if you like potatoes. My favourite Indian potato dish is called aloo gobi – that’s potatoes and cauliflower cooked in yummy spices. One day, I’ll have to find out how healthy potatoes are. I know fried potatoes are high in cholesterol, but I’m not sure about boiled potatoes."
