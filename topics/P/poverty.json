    "txt": "I just don’t understand why we have poverty today. There is so much money in the world. We are rich enough to really make poverty history. My government talks about making a better society while there are thousands of people living on the streets. My government says it is making a more equal society. Rubbish. This is all words. Many people say religion is very important to them but do little to help poor people. In fact, many religious people I know don’t like poor people. And then there are multinational companies who give very little to the poor. They even take away their land and water. The people with the most power to reduce poverty are those doing the least. How can they live in such big houses and drive such fancy cars?"
