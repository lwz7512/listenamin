    "txt": "Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. This is an interesting saying. It’s very true. If you look at the world leaders with the most power, they are the most corrupt. When someone has so much power, they want more. Maybe power is like a disease. It eats into your brain and makes you want more. Once you have a lot of power, you forget about being a real human being. The usual story with people in power is taking lots of money from the country and forgetting about the people. It depends on the country, I suppose. The most powerful person in the world is the president of the USA. But in America, the president doesn’t actually have a lot of power. Every four years, Americans can vote a president out of power."
