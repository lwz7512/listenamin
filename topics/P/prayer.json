    "txt": "Prayer is a very important part of many people’s lives. For those who pray, prayer provides great strength. But there are many people who do not pray. They either do not believe in God or are too lazy. I’m always impressed when people say prayers helped them through difficult times. Sometimes on the news, there is someone who was kidnapped. They tell reporters that praying helped them survive. This is the real power of prayer. Most prayers are more simple. People say prayers to thank God for the good things in their life. They might also ask for help or forgiveness. I’m kind of in between. I pray every day, but I don’t feel my prayers give me a lot of strength. I suppose they might if I hit hard times."
