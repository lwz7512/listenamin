    "txt": "Pregnancy is a time of great emotion, and a bit of pain and discomfort. For most people, the news that a woman is pregnant brings great joy. I remember being too happy to speak. I phoned everyone I knew. From that very minute, your life changes. You start thinking about names and whether it'll be a boy or a girl. Of course, you hope the pregnancy will be problem-free. The hospital visits are exciting. I loved looking at the ultrasound scans. It's amazing to see the tiny baby move and see its heart beat. The later stages of pregnancy are the most difficult. This is when the mother wants the baby to come so she can take the weight off her feet. I reckon pregnancy is similar all over the world."
