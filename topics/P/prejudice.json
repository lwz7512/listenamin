    "txt": "Prejudice is a terrible thing. It really damages our society. It hurts people and can cause great pain. It can even lead people to kill themselves. I’m not sure if prejudice is something that is getting worse or is declining. Were there greater prejudices one hundred years ago than there are today? I think prejudice should be on its way out. The world is getting smaller. We see different cultures more often. Then again, when I look at the news, it seems prejudice is getting worse. Even in my own society I see lots of prejudice. The prejudice is directed against people who are poorer, have a different accent, didn’t go to a good school, belong to the wrong sex. It’s crazy. We are all the same. It’s time we all understood this."
