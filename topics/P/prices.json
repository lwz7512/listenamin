    "txt": "One topic that never goes away is prices. It’s not surprising really. Prices affect us all. The news recently has been about rising prices. But then I suppose that’s always been the news. Prices have been rising a lot though. Especially food. I reckon food prices have gone up 50 per cent in the last year alone. This is because of a rise in the price of oil and because of commodity prices. Everything has gone up. People also complain when some prices go down. When house prices decrease, homeowners get upset. I want to buy a house, so I’m quite happy when houses are cheaper. I would like to see hotel and airline prices come down. Then I can have a nice holiday."
