    "txt": "Pride is a funny thing. Sometimes it’s good. People should take pride in things they do well. It’s also OK to be proud of the people you love. I’m very proud of my children for many reasons. My proudest moment was when my son was born. Sometimes I’m proud of myself. When I’ve done something really difficult, I’m proud of myself. I recently lost a lot of weight so I’m quite proud of that. Last week I told my students I was proud of them. I think teachers are proud of their classes. Of course, there are times when pride is not so good. Sometimes people refuse to say sorry. They know they are wrong, but their pride stops them from apologizing. If more people swallowed their pride, we could get along better."
