    "txt": "Pronunciation is a funny thing. What pronunciation do you study? In England there are a hundred different accents but textbooks only teach one. What use is that? Actually, English teaching textbooks are pretty bad at teaching pronunciation. Look how many exercises there are – very few. And most of the exercises only teach one tiny point of pronunciation – word stress. And they don’t even show that the stress on a word changes in different sentences. I think pronunciation is very interesting. I wish all teachers used the phonemic symbols in every class. At least students could then improve their pronunciation with their dictionary. The most important thing about pronunciation is intonation, but few teachers teach this."
