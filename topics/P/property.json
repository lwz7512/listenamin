    "txt": "Property is one of the best investments you can make. Of course it depends on which country you live in. Buying property usually guarantees your investment will rise in value. If you have a lot of extra cash, you can play the world property market. Places like Dubai and other areas of the Gulf are good places to buy at the moment. I know lots of people who have made a lot of money from property. They have several houses and rent them out. The rent pays the mortgage and after twenty years the house is theirs. I’ve never had any property. I’m still saving up for the deposit to buy a house. I find the property market to be very confusing. I don’t like all the hidden costs involved in buying a property."
