    "txt": "They call prostitution the world’s oldest profession. That’s interesting because in most countries around the world it is illegal. How can you call something illegal a profession? Should prostitution be illegal? If a man or woman wants to sell his or her body, why not? Every government knows it happens in their country. Even countries with the strictest rules have prostitution. Many governments just turn a blind eye to it. The problem with making it illegal is that female prostitutes suffer. They have no legal protection and so their job becomes very dangerous. In Holland, prostitution is legal. Prostitutes must have regular health checks and they can call the police if they get into trouble. This seems more sensible."
