    "txt": "Protests seem to be everywhere today. Whenever I turn on TV there is a protest. Some are against governments, some are against companies, while others are in support of things. I think it's a good thing to demonstrate, as long as it's peaceful. Unfortunately, many governments hate protests and use a lot of force to stop them. Even \"democratic\" countries don't appear to like people protesting in the streets. Some innocent people who just wanted to change things for the better die. Images and news coverage of protests are everywhere nowadays because of the Internet. A few years ago, there would be no reports, photos or videos from some countries. Now we get a lot of news as it happens. That's people power. "
