Looking at how the brain works and how we behave might make me understand people more. I’d particularly like to study child psychology. I love looking at children playing, thinking, drawing… doing anything really. But what makes them tick? What goes on in their little minds? Or perhaps I should say their big minds. If we all knew more about child psychology, perhaps we could do more to be a positive influence on children. Being a psychologist must be a very interesting job. Listening to people talk all day and then analyzing their behaviour. I wonder if they ever get bored."
