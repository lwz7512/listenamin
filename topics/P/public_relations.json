    "txt": "Public relations is becoming a more and more important part of every company. The PR department in some companies is huge. People in PR have to work hard in getting the company’s name out there. I guess sometimes they have to lie. I’m not sure if a lot of PR staff actually believe the advertising of their company. Public relations is also now a huge part of government. The PR of presidents and prime ministers is carefully managed. A lot of taxpayers money is spent on making sure the leader always looks and sounds good. They must always say the right thing and have the perfect image. What a waste of money. When something goes wrong, it’s called a public relations disaster. That means most governments are public relations disasters."
