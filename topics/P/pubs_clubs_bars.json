    "txt": "Where do you go for a good time? Most of the people I know go to a pub, club or bar. Sometimes all three in one night. When I was younger I used to go pubbing and clubbing. We would all meet in a pub and have a few drinks and then go off to a club to dance. When the club shut, we’d head off to a late-night bar. I love going to pubs. They are full of atmosphere. Lots of people chatting, laughing and having a good time. Thankfully, pubs are no-smoking places now, so you can come home without smelling like a cigarette. I also still like clubs, although I’m a bit old now. I love the loud music. It always makes me want to dance. I loved going clubbing in different countries. Different music and atmosphere."
