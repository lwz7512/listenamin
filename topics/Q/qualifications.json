    "txt": "Qualifications are so important these days. Many years ago, a university degree was enough. A B.A. or B.Sc. would guarantee you a good job. Not now. Not even a Master’s degree is enough these days. It seems everyone has a Master’s degree. Some of the jobs I want now require a Ph.D. It’s also not enough nowadays to be happy with the qualifications you have. You have to keep your qualifications up to date, re-qualify, get new qualifications. It seems life has become one long certificate chase. Especially so now that many people will have several careers in their life. I know someone who got a degree in physics, then became an accountant, didn’t like it and studied to be a lawyer. He’s now studying for his teaching license!"
