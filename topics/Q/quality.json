    "txt": "How important is quality to you? It’s very important to me. Unfortunately, a lot of the time it’s also very expensive. But not all of the time. It depends on what you buy. I can buy very good quality clothes very cheaply. They are often the same quality as brand names. It’s also easy to buy good quality food. I go to vegetable and fish markets to get good quality and cheap food. It’s much better than the stuff in supermarkets. It can also be cheaper. I’d love a good quality car, but this is where my budget runs out. It’s still possible to buy a top-of-the-range Japanese car which is the same quality as a much more expensive German one. I do spend a little extra to buy a top quality computer – an Apple."
