    "txt": "Why do people quarrel so much? I hate quarreling. It’s such a waste of time, and it’s usually totally unnecessary. I know a few couples who quarrel non-stop. I really don’t know why they stay together. They quarrel and argue more often they speak to each other normally. Perhaps quarreling is their normal way of communicating. And the things they fight about is amazing, like whether Coke is better than Pepsi. They can get really angry about this. No. There are better things to do than quarrel and argue. I think you should reach an agreement with someone. If an argument looks like appearing, you should both walk away and come back in two minutes. I’m sure that would make a happier world."
