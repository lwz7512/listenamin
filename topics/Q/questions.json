    "txt": "So many questions. I have hundreds. I could probably spend hours writing down all the questions I have. I don’t think I have as many questions as my small children though. They question everything. It’s almost impossible to stop them sometimes. Everything is “Why?” You really have to think sometimes about how to answer. You’re in big trouble if you can’t answer. My biggest questions are about people. I want to know why people kill and how they can be so greedy. I’d love to know why most world leaders rarely keep their promises to their people. I think if you wander around town, your mind will be full of questions. “Why did that person throw that wrapper on the ground?” “Why can’t that driver wait just two seconds?”"
