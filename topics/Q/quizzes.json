I remember looking at quiz shows on TV and getting more questions right than the adults. I guess I had a pretty good general knowledge. I was amazed when the game Trivial Pursuit came out – there were cards with thousands and thousands of quiz questions on them. And these were real questions. I didn’t know half of them. They were tough. I still like quizzes. There are loads of them on the Internet. I can’t resist doing one when I see one. I usually do the news quiz on the BBC. Just ten questions about the week’s news. I think I’ll always like quizzes."
