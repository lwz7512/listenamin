    "txt": "Some people I know are full of quotations. They have remembered hundreds of quotes from Shakespeare and famous poets and politicians. They use them in mid-conversation. I think that’s impressive. I don’t think I could tell you five quotations. I studied Shakespeare at school but I can’t remember a single quote. “To be, or not to be, that is the question.” Was that Shakespeare? I know there’s another famous quote from Romeo and Juliet about the name of a rose. Sometimes I see inspirational quotations on websites. I like these. They make you think. Some of them are really clever. Other places I see quotations are at the end of people’s e-mail. Some of these aren’t so clever."
