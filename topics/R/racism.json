    "txt": "Racism should be decreasing around the world, but it isn’t. I think it’s getting worse. It really is one of the worst things in the world. It’s totally illogical and disgusting. How can you hate someone because of the colour of their skin. I know many horrible people who have my skin colour and many beautiful people with different skin colours. I remember at school hearing racist words said to someone. I felt sorry for him. He was the only non-white person in the whole school. I never understood where the hate came from. Racism never leads to anything positive. Accepting people from other races, and religions and cultures, can only bring many positives to the world. I hope my grandchildren live in a less racist world."
