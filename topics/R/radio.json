    "txt": "It’s amazing how radio is still with us. Everyone thought that television would kill radio. It didn’t. Then music videos and MTV came along. That didn’t really affect radio either. It seems radio is becoming more and more popular these days. You can tune in to almost any radio station in the world nowadays over the Internet. I’m a big fan of radio and can’t live without it. I love radio phone-in shows. It’s fascinating to hear callers call in and talk about the latest news. Even though I have a CD player in my car, more often than not I will listen to the radio. I like not having to choose what to listen to. It’s also useful to get traffic updates. One of my dreams as a kid was to be a DJ and play my favourite songs all day."
