We all listen to the radio at some point in our week. Even with all our new technology, the radio is still an important way of getting music, news and information. I remember my first radio. Forty years ago now. It looks pretty much the same as today’s radios. I used to listen to soccer matches on Saturdays. I still do that. I also loved breakfast radio. I love my iPod but when I’m driving, I turn on the car radio. I like the mix of chat, jokes and songs, except I don’t always like the songs, the jokes or the chat. And some radio presenters are really annoying."
