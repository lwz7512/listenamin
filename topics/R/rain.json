    "txt": "“Rain, rain go away. Come back another day.” This is a nursery rhyme we used to sing in England when we were small. We wanted it to stop raining so we could play. There was nothing more depressing than looking at the rain outside the window when we really wanted to go to the park. People around the world have different opinions on rain. I went to Dubai once and it rained. People were dancing in the streets. They said that rain was so precious. They think it’s a special occasion when it rains so they like to feel it on their skin. That makes sense. I do the same when it snows. People in Alaska might think that’s strange. I wonder how global warming will affect rain. More in some countries, less in others."
