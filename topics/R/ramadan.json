    "txt": "Ramadan is the most important season for all Muslims around the world. I was surprised to find out it lasted a whole month. I was also surprised when I found out that Ramadan is at a different time each year. It usually starts 11 days earlier than the previous celebration, so Ramadan slowly moves from Winter to Summer as the years go by. It starts in the ninth month of the Islamic calendar. This is when the Koran was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad. The Muslims I know love Ramadan. They have to fast between sunrise and sunset. They can’t even have water. Smokers can’t smoke. But then after sunset, they have a party with their family and eat a lot. They party every night for a month. This sounds great."
