    "txt": "Rap music has taken over the world. I think that’s amazing. I was really into all kinds of music when rap first started. I thought it was interesting but never liked it enough to buy any rap. Several decades later, it is a major music genre. The big music awards now have a category for rap. Nowadays, most youngsters are into rap. They love the music and the fashion. Rap is one of America’s biggest cultural exports. When I travel around the world, I see Chinese rappers, Arab rappers, Russian rappers. Everyone is rapping. There is even a famous museum in Washington D.C. that says rap is one of America’s most important inventions. It will probably be as important as jazz. I still don’t understand it. Perhaps I’m too old."
