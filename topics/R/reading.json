    "txt": "Reading is one of the greatest pleasures in life. I would be lost if I didn’t have a good book to read. I can’t remember any time in my life when I wasn’t reading something. I guess you could call me a bookworm. I’ve always got my head buried in a book. I think reading is more than just a hobby. It’s a part of who we are. We learn many things about the world from books. We entertain ourselves with great novels from all over the world, and from the past. Even novels from hundreds of years ago are a great read. You notice how much reading is part of us when you sit on a train. Everyone has a book, magazine, or nowadays, a computer. Everyone seems lost in their own world. The world of reading is not a bad place to be lost in."
