    "txt": "Do you like doing reading activities in class? What are reading activities? Does your teacher explain that you are going to do a reading activity? Reading activities are important. They prepare you to read a text. There are many kinds of reading activities. These can include doing a vocabulary activity on difficult words, looking at pictures, doing a quiz. Anything that helps you understand a reading passage is useful. I’m a teacher. I often wonder whether students like these activities. I’d really like to know how much they help. Reading activities seem to take more time than the actual reading. Maybe if you read the reading three times, you’d understand it better, without doing reading activities."
