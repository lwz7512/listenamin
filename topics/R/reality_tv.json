    "txt": "I don’t get the point of reality TV. First of all, it isn’t real, so I don’t know why they call it reality TV. How can it be real when there are TV cameras everywhere? People don’t act in the same way when there are cameras around. I think it’s the very worst type of television show. It’s all about celebrity and me, me, me. The people who appear in reality TV shows have no talent. There is nothing you can learn from these shows. TV companies must be really short of ideas, or money. I can’t think of a bigger waste of time than looking at a group of people in a room together, and seeing how they get on or don’t get on. I’m amazed they are so popular. Perhaps I’m missing something. If you know what the attraction is, tell me."
