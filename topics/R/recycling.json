    "txt": "When I was young, we never used the word recycling. It wasn’t important. People would think you were crazy for recycling things. Today, things are different. We now know we have a problem. We use too much stuff and throw everything away. Lots of the stuff we throw away is very useful. It can be used again, recycled. This is good for the environment because we use fewer natural resources. I love recycling. It makes me feel as though I’m helping the Earth. I even buy things like used furniture and clothes. This also recycles. Some of the countries I’ve lived in are experts at recycling. There are giant bottle banks at the end of the street and places to leave newspapers, clothes, batteries and metal."
