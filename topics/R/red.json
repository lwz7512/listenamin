    "txt": "Red is my favourite colour. I don’t know why. I have loved the colour red since I was a small child. I even painted my bedroom walls red. My mother wasn’t too happy. Now I’m older I still love red. I always buy a red car. But I never buy red clothes. That’s a bit strange. Red is a very passionate colour. It’s the colour of love. Sometimes I read about the personality profile of people who like red. They are hot-tempered, full of passion and have a great love of life. That doesn’t really describe me. Although I often “see red”. When you see red, it means you get angry. I’m also often “in the red” in the bank. This means I’ve used a little more money than I have. So when I get my bank statement I see red and can see red. "
