    "txt": "Religion is very important for most of the world’s people. Almost everyone believes in a religion. There are hundreds of different religions. The biggest ones are Buddhism, Christianity, Islam and Hinduism. There are other big ones, like Sikhism and Judaism. I think there are two kinds of religion. There are those that believe in God, and those that believe in different gods. Some religions worship animals or godlike figures that look like elephants. There’s one thing I don’t understand about religion. They all tell us to respect people and that the number one sin is to kill another person, but most wars in history have been fought because of religion. What do religious people say about that?"
