    "txt": "I hate paying rent. It’s such a waste of money. And it’s a lot of money. When I pay rent. I always feel like I’m throwing money away. My rent usually takes over half of my salary. Of course, landlords are very happy. They sit back and let the money come in. The rent they receive pays for their housing loan on their house. The thing that annoys me most is that the rent I pay is more than what I would pay if I had a housing loan. Sometimes I’ve paid rent for a really bad place. When something broke, the landlord didn’t fix it. When I said I wouldn’t pay the rent, he told me he’d throw me out. The worst thing about rent is rent increases. These are usually very unfair. That’s just the landlord being greedy."
