    "txt": "Research is a very important thing. Without research, we’d have no new products. Our food would be more dangerous to eat. And we’d never go to the moon. I’d like to see my government spend a lot more money on research. Especially on research into diseases. Scientists have been researching into AIDS and cancer for years and still have not found cures. Research into technology is also important. There seems to be loads of research into information and computer technology. It’s amazing how quickly technology is changing. We really need to spend more to research how global warming is affecting our planet. This could be the most important research scientists ever do. Research to save the planet."
