    "txt": "I love restaurants. I never get tired of going to them. I go to restaurants a lot. Maybe three times a week. I have my favourite restaurants, which I go to regularly. The waiters know me and I usually get very good service. But I also like trying new restaurants. It’s exciting to see what’s on the menu and how the food will taste. Most of the time a visit to a new restaurant is a great experience. But sometimes, I wonder why my friend recommended a restaurant. I’ve been to a few restaurants where the food was so bad, so tasteless, I didn’t want to pay. My favourite restaurants are Indian. I can’t get enough of Indian food. I love the smells inside Indian restaurants. And of course the tastes."
