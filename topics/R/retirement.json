    "txt": "I can’t wait for retirement. I’m praying I can retire early. I like my job, but I like staying at home and doing my own thing more. Many people fear retirement. They worry about what they’ll do. I’m not worried at all. I know I can fill my days forever. Retirement is a time to do all the things you never had time to do because you were working. I have over 1,000 books on my reading list. I have hundreds of things to learn on the computer and lots of new hobbies. Early retirement for me would be 50. Most people retire at 60 or 65. I think 50 would be perfect. You’re still fit and healthy. You can still do lots of things. I wonder what it feels like to retire so young. To wake up every morning and never think about work."
