    "txt": "Rice is a very important food around the world, and I love it. Rice is one thing I seem to be able to eat lots of. It doesn’t matter if there’s a mountain of rice on my plate, I can eat it all. Billions of people eat rice every day. Billions of people probably eat rice three times a day. I could eat rice three times a day, but I don’t. I’m not sure if I could eat rice for breakfast. That’s because I’m English. Lunch and dinner are different, I can eat lots of rice then. The good thing about rice is that if you go to an Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Thai or Mexican restaurant, there’s rice on the menu. And it all tastes so different. Indian Basmati rice with curry is awesome; Japanese rice in sushi is heaven; and Thai rice is unbeatable."
