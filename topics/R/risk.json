    "txt": "Risk is an interesting thing. It is a part of many of our decisions each day. We rarely think about risk, but all of us weigh up risks before we do something. Some risks are simple, but potentially deadly. Do I run across the road now or wait for the green signal? Is it OK to eat this old fish? Other risks are more obvious, like when we invest money. The person in the bank even tells you about the risks and makes a risk profile of you. One financial manager told me I was a cautious risk taker, and then I invested in high-risk products. We can also take risks with our family and friends. Do you risk telling your mother you just broke her precious vase, or do you keep it a secret? Yes, risk is everywhere. Itâ€™s a part of life."
