    "txt": "A long time ago, robots belonged to science fiction. Children loved looking at movies with robots. Today, robots are real, and they are helping us. In the future, we will all have robots. They will vacuum the floor, wash the dishes, perhaps even drive our cars. I even think one day we’ll have robot friends. In Japan today, robot engineers are making robots to help old people and to keep them company. It’s still early days. I’d say we are another 20 to 30 years away from robots being everywhere in our lives. What will happen to us when the world is full of robots? There’ll be no jobs. McDonalds will be full of smiling robots. Maybe one day we won’t be able to tell robots and humans apart. Maybe they’ll take over the world."
