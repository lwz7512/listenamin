    "txt": "Rock and roll is one of the biggest cultural phenomena of the past century. It totally changed society. It had a huge influence on our fashion and lifestyle. Before rock ‘n’ roll, life was slower. Children respected their parents and wore sensible clothes. When rock ‘n’ roll came along, it unlocked children’s craziness. Suddenly everyone wanted to dance and shake their hips. Adults were shocked. The new music made young people feel more independent. They started to rebel against their parents and society. And then came sex and drugs and more rock ‘n’ roll. Thank goodness rock ‘n’ roll came along. Life would be boring without it. I wonder what life would be like if it…. I guess we’d all be wearing sensible clothes. "
