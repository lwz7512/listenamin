    "txt": "Roses are my favourite flower. They are the perfect flower â€“ beautiful in every way. I love the shape of roses and their beautiful colours. Looking at them is like looking at a wonder of nature. The colours are so deep and pure. A white rose is the whitest white, a red rose is the reddest red. And the petals are amazing. They are so silky looking and so perfectly formed. The rest of the rose is also cool. The leaves make the flower look even more beautiful. They have a wonderful shape. The stem is also a part of what makes roses perfect. It is very strong so the rose will always stand tall and strong. All of these things are probably why so many people love roses. There really is no better flower to express love than a red rose."
