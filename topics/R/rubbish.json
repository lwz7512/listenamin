    "txt": "Rubbish is everywhere these days. I’m fed up with it. Every time I walk down the street, I’m almost falling over it. I don’t know why people can’t throw their rubbish away properly. They are lazy and have no respect for others. They don’t seem to care about the environment either. It’s the same in every country. There’s litter in the streets, even though there are rubbish bins everywhere. Rivers are full of plastic bags and bottles. This makes a beautiful place look ugly. And the countryside is full of rubbish. People even throw their TVs and fridges into fields, or anywhere they think people won’t see them. Where I live now, people throw rubbish in the street outside their house. They think other people will pick it up."
