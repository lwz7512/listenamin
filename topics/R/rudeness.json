    "txt": "There is no excuse for rudeness. I don’t understand why people have to be rude. Being polite is a much better way to get things done. If you are rude, the other person will not want to deal with you. It’s not very productive. It probably makes the rude person feel better, who knows? The one place I think there’s no place for rudeness is in stores, hotels, call centres, etc. People in customer service should never be rude. But they are. How many times have you been in a shop and the sales assistant is chewing gum, talking on their mobile phone and totally ignoring you. This makes me want to complain to the manager. People are also rude on the roads. There are so many rude drivers around. I’d love to ask them why they are so rude."
