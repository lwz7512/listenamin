    "txt": "Salad is important. I reckon most of us don’t eat enough salad. We prefer other things. I’m a bit lazy when it comes to salad. I can’t be bothered to make one. If I’m at the salad bar of a restaurant, I will make the effort. I’ll pile as much stuff on my plate as I can. Eating salad is so healthy. I really must try to have some kind of salad two or three times a day. I think if everyone did this, the whole world would be healthier. There are so many delicious salad vegetables. And then you put salad dressing on top to make it extra yummy. Salads just look so healthy, and you feel healthy after eating them. I like all kinds of salad. There are so many, from pasta salads to potato salad to a simple green salad. They’re all tasty and healthy."
