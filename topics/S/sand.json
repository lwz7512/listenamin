    "txt": "Sand is very useful. You can do so many things with it. You can make sand castles, bury yourself in it and sink your toes in it. Perhaps the biggest use of sand is in building. Most of today’s buildings would not be there without sand. I wonder where sand came from. How did it get there? There’s so much sand in the world. I’d love to know how many grains of sand there are in the world. A lot of sand comes from deserts. Going to the desert and looking at the sand is the best thing for me. The many shapes and colours the sand makes is amazing. I once experienced a sand experience. It was a sandstorm. I almost couldn’t see anything in front of me because there was so much sand blowing."
