    "txt": "Most kids say they don’t like school. They say their subjects are boring or there’s too much homework. In fact, school is one of the best times of a person’s life. Think about it. The hours are short – usually just six hours a day. You have the opportunity to learn lots of really useful stuff. You get to do science experiments, learn a musical instrument and play sports. On top of that, you get loads of holidays. Oh, I nearly forgot, you also get to see and play with your friends five days a week. What is there not to like? OK, school lunches are not the best in the world but you can bring your own lunch. And yes, exams are stressful, but if you study, you’ll do well in them. I’d love to go back to school. If I had another chance, I’d try my best in every subject. "
