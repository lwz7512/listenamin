    "txt": "Science is one of the most important subjects we study at school. I loved it. I thought it was so interesting. Time in my science lessons went very quickly because I was always working on things and doing experiments. I liked all of the sciences, physics, biology and chemistry.Â  I wish I continued studying science. I would love to be a scientist now. I think being a computer scientist would be great. Science is so important for our life and our world. All of the world's problems can be solved with science. We can go to different planets because of science. I hope governments pump lots of money into science so we have more and better scientists in the future. It's interesting to think about what future science will be like. "
