    "txt": "Science fiction is one of my favourite genres of books and movies. I like the kind of science fiction that shows what the future might look like on Earth. Science fiction movies like Star Wars are OK but they are full of strange creatures and things weâ€™ll never see. I much prefer movies that are on Earth that show all of the inventions of the future. Robot movies are good. I can see how that will come true. I think people like science fiction because it is like a glimpse into the future. Many of the things that were in science movies from many years ago are true today. Even simple things like the mobile phone. Fifty years ago that was pure science fiction. Not many people thought we could have a phone in our pocket."
