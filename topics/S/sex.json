Basically, sex is what keeps the human race going. Without it, there’d be no babies. I learnt about this when I was about ten. We had a sex education class at school. Of course everyone laughed. But then six years later, we all knew more. I think schools need to teach more about safe sex. There are too many teenage pregnancies. Sex is an important part of relationships, but sometimes it is the cause of marriage break-ups, if one partner has a love affair with another person. This is a problem. Many people, usually men, have sex on the brain."
