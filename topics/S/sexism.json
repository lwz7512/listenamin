    "txt": "There is no place for sexism in our world in the 21st century. Unfortunately, there is a lot of sexism in all societies. It’s slowly disappearing in many countries. In the U.S.A. there are many women in leadership positions. There was almost a female president. There are female leaders in many countries. Despite this, their society is still male-dominated. I think it’ll take a while longer for equality to come. Men have been the leaders and doers for tens of thousands of years. That won’t all change overnight. It is really only in the past few decades that sexual equality is a serious issue. But only in a few countries. A lot of places I’ve been, women are definitely far behind men. They even have to walk behind men."
