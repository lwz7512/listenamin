    "txt": "Shopping must be one of the world’s most popular hobbies. I hate it. There’s nothing more boring than wandering around shopping malls. What a waste of time. I know a lot of people who like window shopping – just walking around shops without wanting to buy anything. Crazy! My plan for shopping is ‘quickly in, quickly out’. If I have to go shopping, I go in the morning on a weekday. This is when the stores are empty and you can get what you want quickly, without thousands of other shoppers getting in your way. The worst time to go shopping is on a Saturday afternoon during sale season. It seems as though all of the world’s bargain hunters are in the same store as you. I was happy when online shopping came along. This is very relaxing."
