    "txt": "Why do we like sightseeing so much? I think it’s because we want to see all the famous places we learnt about when we were at school. I remember learning about the Pyramids in Egypt and really wanting to visit them. Many years later I did. I was one of the thousands of sightseers who crawled around the Pyramids on a hot, Cairo day. I learnt after that to go sightseeing early in the morning. That way you get to the sights before the tour groups have even woken up. It’s lovely to have a world-famous sight all to yourself in the morning. There are so many sights to see it’s difficult to know where to begin, or where to go next. I want to go and see every sight in the world. Early in the morning, of course."
