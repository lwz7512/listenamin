    "txt": "Silence is golden. I like this. It’s very true. It’s not often in our lives that we can enjoy moments of silence. Our world is very noisy. We rarely get the chance to have some peace and quiet. I think we all need some quiet time. We need to think about life. A great place to go for some silence is the top of a mountain or the middle of the desert. You can’t hear anything, except sometimes the wind or a bird. It’s really interesting when you are somewhere that is really silent. It makes you think about how much noise there is around us. There is a strange expression that says silence is deafening. This means it is so silent it really makes you think about the silence. It grabs your attention."
