    "txt": "All the world’s holy books say sin is bad. In each book there are different sins. Each religion tells us what is bad in life. These sins are not all the same. In some religions it is a sin to eat meat, while in others it is only a sin to eat one kind of meat. I think we all know what the big sins are. We mustn’t kill, steal, hurt other people or be jealous. For thousands of years, there have been the Seven Deadly Sins. These are lust, gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, envy and pride. They are everywhere in our society. I don’t think they will ever disappear. What do you think? In fact, I know people who commit these sins every week. If none of us ever sinned, I wonder what kind of place the world would be."
