    "txt": "Few people think about how important their skin is. Men especially. Women spend a lot of time caring for their skin. They seem to have a whole load of skin care products. Their handbags are full of moisturizers, regeneration creams and lotions. Our skin is an organ, like the heart or lungs. We really need to look after it. One thing we really need to do is stay out of the sun. More and more people are getting skin problems because of exposure to the sun. Our skin is very useful. It keeps everything inside our body from falling out. It helps carry blood all around our body, and it is waterproof. Many people worry about their skin. They want it to look perfect. Unfortunately, wrinkles and spots spoil that."
