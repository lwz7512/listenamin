    "txt": "Slavery is one of the biggest tragedies of our history. The terrible thing is that it still happens today in many countries. It has been around since the beginning of our history. Some experts say that philosophers like Aristotle believed some people were born to be slaves. This is clearly not true. Everyone is born with a right to freedom. Unfortunately there are a lot of people in the world today who don’t think so. They think it’s OK to take away another person’s freedom. They use slaves to make themselves richer. This is disgusting. I have been to countries where slave labour is everywhere. Construction workers and maids are paid next to nothing and have to do everything their employer says, 24/7. "
