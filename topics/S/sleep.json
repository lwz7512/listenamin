My mind would be full of knowledge and my friends would be happier. I could also do more exercise and get fitter. I hate feeling tired but I wish my body and brain didn’t need to sleep. It would be great if there was a pill we could take instead of sleeping. I actually find it difficult to fall asleep. I wait for ages before I become tired. I’m a very light sleeper. I wake up at the smallest sound. Not like some of my friends. They can sleep anywhere and it only takes them 30 seconds to fall asleep. They’re gone as soon as their head hits the pillow."
