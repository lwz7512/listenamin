    "txt": "Smells are interesting. It’s amazing how many smells we know. Our noses are excellent at understanding thousands of different fragrances and odours. We all have favourite smells. Mine are freshly baked bread and freshly brewed coffee. Many people spray themselves with perfume to make themselves smell “nicer”. Personally, I think perfume is horrible. I hate smelling other people’s perfume. Smells can bring back memories. I’m sure everyone has an experience of smelling something that makes them think back to their childhood. I love smells that other people don’t like. I love the smell of the countryside and farms. I also quite like the smell of petrol, but I don’t want to smell it too much because of the chemicals."
