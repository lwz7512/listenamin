    "txt": "Isn’t smiling the best thing we can do in life. There needs to be more of it. I feel so happy if I go into a store and the assistant smiles. The world would be a much nicer place if everyone smiled. Unfortunately, not everyone smiles. Some miserable people I know always ask, “What is there to smile about?” I always smile when I hear this. It’s funny. There’s a lot to smile about. If you smile a lot, it shows you like life and are easy to get on with. People who do not smile are difficult to be with. I often smile to myself when I’m on my own. Walking in a garden or looking at children can make me smile. I always smile when I meet new people, but not everyone smiles back. Smiling is very important to me."
