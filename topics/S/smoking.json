    "txt": "Smoking is a terrible thing. There’s nothing good about it. I don’t know how cigarette companies can advertise their products. Cigarettes kill people. Smoking is not cool. Last century, cigarette companies tried to make people think it was. They even told people that cigarettes were good for your health. How ridiculous. Everyone today knows that smoking is one of the least cool things you can do. Unfortunately, cigarette companies are doing a good job of selling their products to children. Smoking is on the increase in countries like China and pretty much all over Africa. This is sad. Once people get enough information about the dangers of smoking, perhaps millions will quit this terrible habit."
