    "txt": "I think snakes are very interesting. They have a very strange effect on people. Some people are fascinated by them, but others are terrified of them. I love looking at them. They really are fantastic creatures. It’s almost as if they come from another planet. The best snakes are the really big ones. Pythons and anacondas are absolutely huge. I reckon they could easily eat me. I also like the really colourful ones. They look dangerous. I’m glad I live in a country where there are no snakes. It’s OK looking at them in a zoo, but I’m not sure I’d like to see them in my garden. I heard Australia has six of the world’s ten most deadly snakes. I wonder if Australians see snakes a lot. It must be a bit scary hiking there."
