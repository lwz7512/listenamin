    "txt": "I love snow. I always get really excited when it snows. I live in a country where it doesn’t snow a lot. Some winters, it doesn’t snow at all. So when it does snow, I’m really happy. The more snow, the better. When I was a kid I used to pray for snow in the winter. That’s because the school bus didn’t come so we couldn’t go to school. Now I’m older, I still want it to snow a lot. I love the way it changes the landscape. There’s nothing in the world more beautiful than looking at fields, trees, mountains, and houses covered with snow. I have to go for a walk in the snow. It’s great fun. Of course I have to make and throw snowballs, perhaps have a snowball fight. And I have to make a snowman with my kids."
