I just Googled ‘social issues’ and found a list of 33 different issues. I suppose that’s not a huge amount. One thing that surprised me looking at the list is how common they are. Pretty much all of them appear on the news most days. A few of them weren’t really in the news when I was growing up. I can’t remember hearing about drug abuse, pollution and immigration years ago. I hope that the number of social issues on this list goes down and not up, although I suspect there will more problems in the future. I think there’ll be problems about things we don’t even know about today."
