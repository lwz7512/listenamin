    "txt": "What is the big deal with social networking? I don’t understand it. I know a lot about computers. I spend a long time every day on computers. I also have a lot of friends. But I don’t see the point of social networks. I joined Facebook but couldn’t be bothered to make my profile. I can’t see a single use of this site. Most of what I’ve heard about it isn’t so good. Putting too much personal information on this site isn’t a wise idea. I’ve also experimented with Twitter, but again, I don’t really see what use it has. I suppose it’s good to tell the world what’s happening in countries that take away people’s freedom. My idea of social networking is meeting people face to face and talking to them."
