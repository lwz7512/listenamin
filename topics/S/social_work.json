It’s sad this happens when there are so many people who need help. I want the tax I pay to help old people who have no money or one-parent families. If more money was spent on people who need help, our society would be better. I always thought that’s what a government was for – to help people. There should also be more social workers. I’m sure if governments asked people, they would say spending more money on social work is a good thing. It seems as though social work is becoming less important. Just look at the number of homeless in the streets of the world’s richest countries."
