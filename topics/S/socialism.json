    "txt": "Lots of people say socialism is the best system to run a country. It seems the fairest way. I like the idea that all people are the same and should be paid more or less the same. I’ve often thought it’s unfair that in our capitalist world, many people get paid huge amounts of money while others have too little money to survive. It’s not right that one person can get millions of dollars a month, while others are lucky to get one thousand dollars. Most of the time, it depends on your luck when you’re born. You go to a good school and then get a good job. Or at least we are told it’s a good job. Personally, I don’t think bank managers should earn more than nurses, and sport stars shouldn’t earn more than soldiers."
