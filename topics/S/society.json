    "txt": "Is society going uphill or downhill? It certainly is an interesting thing. We are all part of society and we all have to deal with its problems. Also, we all have a duty to do our part for society. All societies are different. I suppose everyone thinks their society is best. There are good and bad things about all societies. Japanese society, Saudi Arabian society and Australia’s Aboriginal society are all unique. So are all the other societies in the world. One day, there might be only one society – a world society. As the world gets smaller and smaller, we might all become the same. We might even look the same. I wonder what that would be like. One language, all the same colour, the same laws, the same education. Interesting."
