    "txt": "Solar energy is the key to our future. If we do not use it, our planet will not survive. We do not have enough resources on Earth to supply our energy needs. We are slowly using solar energy more. Most places you go in the world today you can see solar panels on people’s houses. I hope that in the future, all houses will use solar power. It’s so simple. In fact, it’s free. All you have to do is pay for the solar panels and some other equipment, and then you have free energy. Research into solar energy is still in its early days. I think in the future it will be everywhere. We’ll be able to buy solar panels from our local DIY store. I also think we’ll be wearing clothes that provide solar power, and we’ll be driving cars powered by solar energy."
