When I was a kid I learnt there were nine planets, but some time ago, scientists decided Pluto wasn’t a planet. All of the names of the planets in our solar system are really cool. Everybody knows the names because they are used every day in advertising or to name cars and things. Pluto was even the name of a Disney character. I think Saturn is the name of a car and Mercury is the name of a radio station. I love looking at photos of the solar system. They get more beautiful as our technology gets better. One day we’ll go on solar system tours."
