    "txt": "Soldiers have an unbelievably difficult job. Sometimes I don’t understand why people become a soldier. You can die. The life of a soldier is very tough. You have to train very hard every day and carry really heavy things. You have to march over mountains for days and sleep in the desert. You also have to learn to fight and do many dangerous things. Some soldiers don’t have to worry too much. If you’re in an army in a country that never goes to war, it’s probably a good job. Being an American or British soldier is a very dangerous job. They’re always fighting somewhere. One big problem today is child soldiers. There are armies in the world that kidnap children and make them fight."
