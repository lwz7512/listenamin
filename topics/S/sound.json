    "txt": "Sound is something few of us rarely think about. It’s always around us in one form or another. I even think there’s sound if everything is completely silent. There is actually a famous song called the Sound of Silence. When I was a child, my parents or teachers would tell me not to make a sound. This was usually when I did something wrong. I tried not to make a sound, but it’s pretty difficult. Try it. There are all kinds of sounds in the world. You can put them in categories. There’s the sound of the city, the sound of the jungle and the sound of the ocean, just to name a few. My favourite sounds are those of laughter and fun. That always makes me happy. My most hated sound is the sound of traffic."
