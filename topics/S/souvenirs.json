    "txt": "Souvenirs are funny things. Most of us feel we need to buy a souvenir when we go to another country. Then when we get home we put it on top of the television. When visitors come, we tell them about it and where we got it. A lot of the souvenirs we buy are rubbish. I have a long history of buying things that look horrible, are cheap and don’t really match my house – just because they are souvenirs. It’s almost as if we are programmed to buy a souvenir. I know some people who spend hours wandering around souvenir shops. What a waste of time. I decided never to buy a souvenir again. I’d much rather spend my time doing something more interesting. The best souvenirs are memories and photos."
