    "txt": "Speed kills. This is something I remember from a road safety campaign many years ago. It’s true. There are too many drivers who drive too fast. So many people are killed on the road because of speed. I don’t understand why people don’t follow the speed limits. Many people are addicted to speed. Of course, it is exciting to go fast. That’s why things like roller coasters are so exciting. The faster they are, the better they are. It’s different for cars though. I think governments should limit the speed a car can go. If the speed limit on the road is 100kph, why sell cars that can go 200kph. I hope in the future they have sensors on the road that can control the speed of your car."
