    "txt": "I'm terrible at spelling. It's so confusing. I really wish someone would change every word in English to make the spelling logical. I don't know how English people can spell. My teacher says many English people can't spell. English spelling is difficult even for native speakers. My teacher said she is now confused between British and American spelling. She forgets which is which. I'm not sure whether it matters. If one of the spellings is right, that's good enough. I hate having spelling tests at school. I never get full marks. I know spelling is important because one wrong letter can change the meaning of the word. I wish someone would create a good system for us. We need a better way of learning how to spell. "
