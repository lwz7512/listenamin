How can we remember when a ‘c’ sounds like a ‘k’ or an ‘s’? It’s sometimes impossible to figure out why words are spelled the way they are. There are loads of really good websites that have spelling activities. We need to do more of these in class. There must be a teacher’s book with spelling games in it. Even if the teacher spent five minutes a lesson on spelling, that would be really, really helpful. I suppose it would take a lifetime to learn all of the different spelling rules. My teacher even told me he didn’t know most of them."
