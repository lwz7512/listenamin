If they were the size of large dogs, people wouldn’t like them so much. Can you imagine if they were that big? We’d be in big trouble. Spiders are among the most dangerous species in the world. They have hundreds of deadly poisons. They can kill things ten times bigger than themselves. If you look at spiders really closely, they really do look like scary monsters. All those eyes and legs and bodies. They make me shiver just thinking about them. Spiders are useful though. They are good at tidying up their environment."
