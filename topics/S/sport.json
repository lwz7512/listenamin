I wasn’t very good at football when I was a kid. This did not stop me playing. I played in the park with my friends for hours every day. What is your national sport? Do you like it? I love Japan’s national sport sumo. It is one of the most exciting sports in the world. You have to spend a little time getting to know the rules and the fighters. The greatest thing about sport is that it brings people together from all over the world. Another good thing is that it keeps us healthy. Sports stars are very lucky. They love their job and stay fit by doing it every day. What are you going to play next?"
