    "txt": "Spring is a time for doing things. It seems everyone is full of energy. The days become warmer so everyone spends more time outside. Winter is finishing, so the countryside becomes greener. I love watching the new flowers in my garden in spring. I watch the tulips grow and then I know winter is over. I wonder what it’s like to live in countries that don’t have four seasons. They miss out on what it’s like to welcome spring and see everything come alive. Spring has to be the best season. It definitely makes you feel very positive about life. It’s a good time to clean your house from top to bottom. We call this spring cleaning. Spring also means the weather gets warmer and you can do more things outside."
