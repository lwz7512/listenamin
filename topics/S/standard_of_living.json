    "txt": "Standard of living is something very important to all of us. We all want a better standard of living. We all do our best for most of our lives to improve it. I’m quite happy with my standard of living. I’m not rich, I don’t have expensive furniture (in fact I have cheap used furniture) and I don’t have luxury holidays overseas. I don’t think you need a lot of money to have a good standard of living. As long as you are comfortable in your home and you can buy food and go out a few times a week, your standard of living should be fine. Mine is much better than 90 per cent of the world’s population. This is probably true for you, if you are reading or listening to this. We all need to think how lucky we are."
