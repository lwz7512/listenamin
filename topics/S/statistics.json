    "txt": "There are lies, damned lies, and statistics. I like this saying. It means statistics lie even more than the biggest lies. It’s true. Statistics can be used to dress up any numbers. Politicians always use statistics to let us know things are better than they really are. Or sometimes to show things are much worse. Most governments have departments that pump out statistics. I actually like statistics. It’s interesting to look at the figures and make comparisons. I also like trying to find patterns in the numbers. My favourite statistics are about football. I can look at football stats for hours. The statistics I don’t like so much are those about my finances. There’s lots of red ink with these numbers and lots of minus signs."
