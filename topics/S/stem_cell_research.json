    "txt": "I’m all for stem cell research. I know it is a huge issue at the moment. Lots of people don’t like it. They say it is unethical and that it is playing God. Other people say we will create Frankenstein’s monster. Britain seems to be leading the world in this research. The government has passed laws to encourage it. British scientists have made many discoveries with stem cell research. For a long time America did very little research. President Obama changed that and now American scientists are doing lots of research. I don’t think you can stop scientists doing research. It’s a part of the history of science. I think stem cell research is very important. It will lead to many cures for diseases."
