    "txt": "Aren’t stereotypes funny? Why is it we all have a typical image of people from other countries. Not all stereotypes though are to do with nationality. We have stereotypes on jobs – the typical accountant or computer software designer. Stereotypes even cover race and religion. Actually, thinking about it, stereotypes aren’t that funny. They make fun of people. Even worse, they put people in a negative light. When we see cartoons of stereotypes, we laugh at them. This is not nice. It’s not good to laugh at a nationality. I think stereotypes do harm in the world. They don’t really bring people together. I don’t fit the stereotype of people from my country. I don’t carry an umbrella and I don’t drink tea."
