    "txt": "The stock market is a hot topic these days. Since the credit crisis began in September 2009, people have been watching stock prices very carefully. A lot of people have lost a lot of money because share values have fallen. The stock market is a strange thing. People invest money in it for years for their pensions. To me, that seems risky. It’s fine if companies keep doing well, but that’s not what happens. The recent global financial crisis shows this. People lost half the value of their lifetime savings overnight. Billions of dollars gone. Whose fault is it? I wonder if people will trust the stock markets again. I guess the big markets will bounce back and trading will continue as normal, until the next stock market crash."
