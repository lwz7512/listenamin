I need to tell myself that the stressful situation will be over soon. I wonder if people are more stressed today than they were 100 years ago. I think they probably are. There are more things to get stressed about these days – exams, money, jobs, trains, anything and everything. I get stressed when I have to meet a deadline and the time is running out. Fortunately, there are many things to do to get rid of stress. I reduce my stress by chatting with friends or going for a run. Life seems better then. Hmmm… I wonder what will give me stress next. I’ll get my running shoes ready so I can manage it."
