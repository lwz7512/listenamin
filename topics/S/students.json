    "txt": "Being a student is a good life. I don’t think most students understand this. A lot of students complain they have no money and too much homework. They never complain that they have loads of free time, don’t have to go to work and have really long holidays. When students finish being students and go to work, they understand how good it is to be a student. Being a student at high school can be tough. You have to study boring things and deal with things like bullying. Going to college or university is when the fun starts. Just a few hours of classes a week and lots of student parties. I’d love to be a student again. I know many people who’d like to be full-time students forever. All you need is a bit more cash."
