    "txt": "Love it or hate it, studying is one of the most important things we do in life. We all start school around the age of four and then it’s study, study, study. Some of us are good at it and like it. Some people even become lifelong learners and study into their old age. I know one woman who’s over seventy and is doing her fifth Master’s degree. Other people hate studying. Many people leave school at the age of 15 or 16 and get a job. They like the idea of getting money and not having homework. The truth is, however, studying is one of the best ways to make sure you do well in life. The more you study, the more qualifications you have and the better job you can get. I really think everyone would love studying if they studied something interesting."
