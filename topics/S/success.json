For other people, success only means being the best in the world. If a sports star comes second in the world championship, they feel they are not a success. I have successes every day, especially at work or in my hobbies. If I learn a new piece of software, that’s a success and I’m happy. Recently I have had many successes in the kitchen. I love cooking, so every time someone likes my food, I feel it’s a success. I really wish my football team would be more successful. They’re always on the brink of success, but then fail."
