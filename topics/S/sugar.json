    "txt": "Sugar is an interesting food. Is it food? I’m not sure what sugar is. It seems as though the world is addicted to sugar. We cannot do without it. I wonder how much sugar we have every day. When I was a kid, I loved sugary things. I even used to eat sugar cubes. That’s so bad for your teeth. I still have a sweet tooth but I have cut down on the amount of sugar I have. I used to have three sugars in my tea. Now I have none – three sugars in tea is more like syrup. There are two things about sugar I love. I love sprinkling a little sugar on strawberries and I love sugar cane juice. Apart from that, I think I could easily live without sugar. I’m not sure if other people can. What would life be like without sugar?"
