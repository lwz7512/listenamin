    "txt": "Suicide is a sad and terrible thing. The Bible said it’s one of the biggest sins, but I’m not so sure about that. People take their own lives for many reasons. They have lost their job, lost hope, lost everything in life. They have no one to turn to for help. I don’t really understand why people commit suicide though. Everyone has one person to talk to. I especially don’t understand why people kill themselves if they have family. That means they have a lot to live for. With the stresses of modern life, suicide is on the increase. There are even many online websites that help you through suicide. I think it’s a tragic part of society. No one should ever be so sad and without hope that they end their life."
