    "txt": "The best thing about living in a country that has four seasons is summer. Everyone looks forward to it. Summer is a time when we have picnics in the park and the sky is always blue. I go to the beach a lot in the summer and go hiking. It can never get too hot. I live in a country where summers are nice. I’m not sure if I could live somewhere where summers are unbearable. I like shopping for summer clothes. I usually wait until autumn when summer clothes are on sale. They’re not really in fashion for the next summer, but I don’t care. One thing I don’t understand about summer is summer holidays. Everyone I know goes to a warm country in the summer. That’s crazy. It’s warm here. Why not go to a warm country in the winter?"
