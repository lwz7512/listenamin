    "txt": "Sumo is the national sport of Japan. It is very popular there, but its popularity is decreasing. This is because the top champions are no longer Japanese. There have been more champions from Hawaii and Mongolia in the past decade than Japanese. Sumo is misunderstood around the world. Many people don’t know it’s a martial art. People also say the guys who battle against each other are wrestlers. They’re not. They’re called rikishi. And a lot of people think sumo is just two fat men pushing each other. It’s not. Sumo is incredibly exciting and skillful. Easily one of the most exciting sports around. I love everything about sumo. I love the ceremonies before the fights begin. I love the traditions, the history and the costumes."
