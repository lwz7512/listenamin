You can’t compare the Super Bowl to any other sporting event. It’s even better than the Olympics. It’s one hundred times more exciting than the soccer World Cup. This year is extra special. My favorite team’s playing – the New Orleans Saints. The Indianapolis Colts are the favorites. We’re the underdogs, but I don’t care. I have this feeling we’re gonna win big. I also just found out the British rock group The Who are performing during the halftime show. I love those guys – they really rock. All in all I think Super Bowl 44 will be totally awesome."
