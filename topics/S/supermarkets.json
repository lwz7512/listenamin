    "txt": "I think supermarkets are interesting places. They are packed with thousands of different kinds of goods and products. There is an army of workers making sure the shelves are stocked and everything looks nice. And the prices are usually cheap. The only thing I don’t like about supermarkets is when I have to pay. I hate waiting in line at the check-outs. Another thing I hate is when I get a trolly with a wobbly wheel. I really like going to supermarkets in different countries. Each country has very different things. In England, you’ll see a huge cheese section; in Japan, you’ll see a whole aisle selling seaweed; in the Middle East, you’ll see shelves and shelves of dates and olives; and my favourite is India and the hundreds of colourful spices."
