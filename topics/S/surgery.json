    "txt": "Surgery has saved or improved millions of lives. It’s amazing to think that doctors have the ability to cut us open and repair us. Some of the surgery nowadays is unbelievable. Doctors and surgeons can replace organs like the heart, operate on the brain, and repair the lens in our eyes. A lot of what surgeons do is like a miracle. They truly have our life in their hands when we’re on the operating table. One of the recent developments is keyhole surgery. This is where doctors no longer need to cut you open to operate. They stick thin instruments into a small hole in your body and use a camera to do the operation. I can’t imagine what operations of the future will be like. Maybe we’ll operate on ourselves."
