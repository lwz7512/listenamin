    "txt": "The idea of sweatshops makes me very angry. Thereâ€™s nothing good about them. Very young children have to work in horrible factories that are bad for their health. They eat and sleep at the factories. Their bosses make them work up to 16 hours a day and sometimes beat them. Not just children, poor people too. The factory owners get rich because of the near slave-labour conditions. The worst thing about sweatshops is that lots of multinational companies buy the clothes and shoes made by the children. Companies like Gap and Nike have been in the news for exploiting children in sweatshops. I think these companies have a big responsibility to make sure their goods do not come from sweatshops."
