    "txt": "Tax is a necessary evil. That’s what many people say. I think it is necessary because it’s the only way to keep a country going. Without the government collecting taxes, it would have no money to spend on education, the police, hospitals, roads, etc. Not every country has the same taxation system. People in Sweden and Denmark pay very high tax, but then schools, hospitals and other social services are free. Tax there pays for an excellent welfare system. In America, tax is lower but there’s almost no welfare system. Americans have to pay for their own healthcare. If you have no money or insurance, you can’t go to hospital. I don’t mind paying tax, as long as my taxes don’t go to pay for nuclear weapons or fund wars."
