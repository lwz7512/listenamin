    "txt": "I wonder what life would be like without taxis. No one ever really stops to think how important taxis are. They are everywhere. Just think how convenient they are. All you do is walk out onto the street, raise your hand, and a cab stops. It then takes you anywhere you want to go. Hailing a cab in large cities is as easy as anything. I think everyone has a favourite taxi story. My best experience was with a Cairo taxi driver. I was late for a train. I told him I’d pay double if he could get me to the station in fifteen minutes. It was like a formula one race. We got there early and I gave him a big tip. I’m always amazed by London taxi drivers. They are called cabbies and know every street in London and the quickest way from A to B."
