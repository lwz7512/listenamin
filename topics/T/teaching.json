This is surprising because most governments say education is their top priority. Teaching is also one of the world’s most stressful jobs. I read somewhere it was in the top ten. I wonder if teaching is fun. I like teaching people things. I taught my younger brothers and sisters loads of things. I suppose teaching as a teacher is different. You have lots of classes to teach and lots of homework to mark. I think all of my teachers at school loved teaching. I was lucky. They did a good job at making their subject interesting. I think teaching is probably quite difficult."
