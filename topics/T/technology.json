    "txt": "What would we do without technology? Would we still be living in caves? Probably. I think there are two main kinds of technology. The kinds before and after computers. When we think about technology before computers, it was quite basic. It was all mechanical. Things like steam trains and fridges. At the time, that was cutting edge technology. But, today’s technology is really cutting edge. It’s the kind of technology that is out of date as soon as it hits the shelves. I love this. It’s so exciting seeing it all happen. I love reading about what technology we’ll have in the future, and then buy it a few years later. It’s like buying technology from science fiction movies. I’d love to live to be 200 so I can see what technology is around then."
