    "txt": "Teddy bears are very important. They play a special role in our society. The funny thing is, they have been with us for less than a hundred years. Of course, when we think about teddy bears, we think about children. I think it’s impossible for a child to grow up without a teddy bear. Unfortunately, today, teddy bears have a lot of competition. There are lots of stuffed animals to choose from in toy stores. I would much rather have a traditional teddy than a Mickey Mouse or a soft toy cat. Teddy bears are not just for children. Adults have them too. Boyfriends and girlfriends buy them for each other as gifts. I’m 49 and I have a teddy bear of my favourite soccer club, but we’ll keep that a secret."
