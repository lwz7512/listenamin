    "txt": "Our teenage years are probably the most difficult of our lives. This is the time we pass from childhood into adulthood. So many things are happening to us. Our bodies change, our emotions change and our whole life changes. We have to learn to be independent, mature and responsible in a few short years. We have to take exams, get a job and perhaps start a family. That must come as a bit of a shock for most teenagers. Part of all this new independence is teenage behaviour. This is probably the most difficult part of parents’ lives. All those moods and all that sulking. It can put a strain on family life. People always think they really want babies and children; no one ever says “I want a teenager”."
