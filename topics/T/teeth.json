    "txt": "Nowadays everyone wants perfect teeth. People want to have the same teeth as Hollywood or Bollywood movie stars. Every fashion, film or music magazine is full of photos of people with lovely teeth. My teeth aren’t straight. My two front teeth are crooked and there’s a gap between them. They are also not brilliant white. I don’t know how movie stars have such whiter than white teeth. I brush my teeth three times a day but they’ll never be white. I’ve lost a lot of my teeth. That happens when you get old. I’m looking forward to getting a pair of false teeth. I’ll buy a sparkling set of dentures. When I smile, I’ll look like a million dollars. People say a good set of teeth will make you more successful in life. I wonder if that’s true."
