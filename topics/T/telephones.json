    "txt": "Telephones are a major part of our lives these days. When I was growing up, I perhaps used the phone once a week. It was almost a big event when it rang. Everyone rushed into the living room to find out who was calling. Of course, it was an old-style phone – the size of a football. And you had to leave it on the table because it was plugged into the wall. Today, however, is a totally different matter. Everyone has a phone. Some people I know have several. They change them every six months when the latest models come out. Today’s phones aren’t really phones. They are like personal entertainment devices that have a phone. I’m waiting for the watch phone. I’m sure it’ll be here soon."
