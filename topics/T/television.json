    "txt": "What do you think? Is television good or bad? I loved it when I was a kid. My eyes were glued to the TV screen for hours and hours. I watched cartoons and other kids’ shows non-stop. It was good at the time, but maybe I should have been outside playing or doing something more useful. There’s a lot of rubbish on TV. There are so many programmes that you watch just because you’re too lazy to do something useful. A lot of people turn on the TV and sit in front of it all day or all night. What a waste of time! I think television programmes are getting worse. Reality TV and celebrity chat shows are the worst. The only good things on TV nowadays is the news, live sport and comedy shows. Plus an interesting documentary or two."
