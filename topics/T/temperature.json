    "txt": "It seems as though temperatures are rising these days. Everyone knows it’s because of global warming. It’s very dangerous. Higher temperatures are causing a lot of problems for the world. There are more hurricanes and floods. One of the most obvious signs of rising temperatures is the melting ice caps. Large parts of the Arctic and Antarctic are melting because the world is getting warmer. All over the world, countries are reporting their latest record temperatures. When I was a kid, I remember a newspaper headline in England because the temperature reached 30 degrees. It was major news. Now in England it's not unusual for it to be over thirty every summer. I hope temperatures don’t go up much more."
