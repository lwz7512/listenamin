    "txt": "Tennis is one of the greatest games in the world. You can see people playing it in pretty much every country on Earth. Anyone can play it. All you need is a tennis racket and a ball. You can even play it when you’re three or four years old. Most of the tennis superstars start then. I spent many years when I was younger playing tennis. I was never any good, but I loved playing it. I remember having arguments with my friends over whether the ball was in or out. I’m sure I lost games because my friend said out when it was really in. The good thing about tennis is that many countries are good at it. This makes it a true world sport. There are also major tournaments that everyone in the world talks about. My favourite is Wimbledon."
