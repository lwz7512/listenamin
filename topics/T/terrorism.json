    "txt": "Ever since I can remember, I’ve seen terrorism on the news. I grew up in London. In the 1970s, we had a lot of bombings and I even heard a bomb once. There has also been terrorism in other countries from Spain to Sri Lanka. But terrorism really hit the headlines after 9-11. Suddenly there was a war on terror. The whole Western world prepared for terrorist attacks. And they came. There were bombs that killed hundreds in Bali and Spain and Iraq and London. Now Pakistan is feeling the terrible force of terrorism. When will it all stop? There has to be a time when people are happy and can live a day without wanting to blow up people they don’t know. So much would change in the world if this happened."
