People who are good at remembering lots of things for a short time are good at tests. People who are geniuses but panic in tests aren’t good at tests. Many clever people fail tests. Sometimes you can be really unlucky and you get some stupid questions, so you fail. I’m sure there are better ways of testing without tests. Project work is good – that way the teachers can see how good your work is throughout the year. I suppose some tests are necessary. Driving tests are a good way of testing your ability – unless you have a bad day."
