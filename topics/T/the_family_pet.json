    "txt": "I don’t understand why people want a pet. It’s strange. Why would you want an animal to live in the same house as you? Some people let their pets sleep on their bed. This doesn’t sound too hygienic to me. Cats and dogs spend a long time outdoors, putting their feet in all kinds of mess. Then they come in the house with their dirty feet and walk all the bed. And pets smell. I suppose a cat or dog can be good for old people who live alone. Many old people talk to their pets. Small children also like pets. Looking after a cat, dog, hamster or rabbit teaches children responsibility. Some people have really strange pets, like tarantulas or tigers. Perhaps the most boring pet is a goldfish. You can’t do a lot with a goldfish."
