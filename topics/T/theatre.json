    "txt": "When I was growing up, I always thought the theatre was for rich people. I guess in a way it is. Theatre tickets in London are pretty expensive, especially for a whole family. But as I got older, I found you could go to the theatre quite cheaply. I found dozens of smaller theatres in London that had very reasonable prices. You could also get discount tickets for the big theatres. Going to the theatre is a wonderful experience. It’s great sitting in your seat with your programme. I always wonder what the set will look like. I’m always impressed by the quality of acting. Actors are brave people. They stand on stage in front of an audience of hundreds, and look so calm and confident."
