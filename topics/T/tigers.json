    "txt": "Tigers are the most beautiful creatures on Earth. They look so striking in every way. Their size is awesome. They are much bigger than humans, and ten times more powerful. They are very fast and very agile. But the best thing is their colour and pattern. I can’t think of another animal that has better colours. I also love looking at tigers’ faces. Nowadays though, I get a little sad when I look at tigers. I always wonder how long they can survive. The number of tigers around the world is decreasing every year. Their habitat is getting smaller and more people are hunting them. There is a big danger that tigers will become extinct. We might have tigers in zoos, but it’s not the same."
