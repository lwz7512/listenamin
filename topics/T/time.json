    "txt": "There never seems to be enough time to do things. I always seem to run out of time. I really wish there were more hours in the day. Then I could slow down and relax, and get everything done. Time is a fun thing. Sometimes it flies – usually when you’re having fun. Other times it drags and goes painfully slowly. Sometimes I look at the clock and I think it’s going backwards. I think it’s very important to spend my time wisely. It’s too important to waste. For me, time is very precious at the weekends. I can spend some quality time with my family and friends. I always have a good time at the weekend. I like the expression time is money. It kind of shows how valuable time is. Oh well. That’s that. Time for me to go now."
