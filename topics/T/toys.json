    "txt": "I love toys. And I’m nearly fifty years old. I think they’re great fun. Of course I only play with toys with my grandchildren. Toys of any kind keep children happy. Even if it’s a horrible, cheap, free toy from McDonalds, they love them. The thing that amazes me is how little toys have changed. The same toys are in the shops today as when I was a kid. I guess some toys will never change. There’ll always be Lego and cars and toy telephones. The biggest difference with today’s toys is that many are digital. Today’s toys speak to you and children interact with them more. They’re not so good in the bath, though. I don’t think I’ll ever get tired of toys. I still love going to toy stores and buying them – as presents, of course."
