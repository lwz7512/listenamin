    "txt": "Someone really should do something about the traffic. It’s terrible. It’s getting worse every day. There are so many cars on the roads these days. It’s a nightmare driving in the city. Bumper to bumper even at midnight. I don’t know where all this traffic came from. You turn on the radio and the traffic report is all about congestion here, snarl-ups and gridlocks there. The answer must be to get better public transport. Let people take the train or bus. People need to leave their cars at home. The roads are too dangerous. And then there’s the pollution. It’s disgusting outside sometimes. You feel like you’re breathing pure fumes. We need to get rid of these traffic jams so we can move and breathe more easily."
