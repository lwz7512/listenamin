    "txt": "Translation is a tricky business. There are so many things that are very difficult to translate from one language to another. Of course lots of words are easy. A book is a book in all languages. But is it? In English you can “go by the book” if you want to follow the rules. What book is this? Many of the things that are difficult to translate are cultural. I also think it’s pretty much impossible to translate jokes and humour. I think that’s why we have the expression “lost in translation”. Being a translator must be a difficult job. Especially translating things like legal documents. If you make one tiny mistake, you could mess everything up. One day we’ll translate everything on the Internet."
