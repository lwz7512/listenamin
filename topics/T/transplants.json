    "txt": "Transplants are amazing. It’s incredible to think how much doctors can do. A few decades ago, doctors conducted the first heart transplant. It was headline news. It was like a medical revolution, the greatest breakthrough in science. Today, thousands of heart transplants take place around the world every day. No more headlines. What makes the headlines today is a face transplant. That’s weird. Imagine waking up one day and you have another person’s face. It’s great though. The face transplants that have taken place have totally changed lives. I wonder what other transplants we'll have next. What would a brain transplant do? That would be really scary. This would be the same as having a personality transplant."
