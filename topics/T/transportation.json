    "txt": "Transportation hasn’t really changed a lot in the past 100 years. When you think about changes in other areas of our life, transportation is pretty much the same as it was years ago. OK, cars, trains and airplanes are faster, but they’re not so different than they were 50 years ago. Take airplanes, for example. I think air travel has got worse. Fifty years ago, people flew and were given great service. Today, you are like sardines in a can. And look at cars. The cars from fifty years ago look nicer than today’s ones. They still had four wheels, used petrol and had a steering wheel. I think transportation will really only change when it becomes more personal. I’m waiting for my own jet pack of mini-copter."
