    "txt": "Travelling gives you many wonderful experiences you cannot find in your own country. You meet local people and get to understand different cultures. It’s so exciting. I love planning trips and doing some research on the country or countries I want to visit. Sometimes I like to plan everything in advance, my flights, hotels and tours, etc. For me, the most exciting thing is arriving in a country with no hotel reservation and no fixed plans. I prefer staying in hostels and guest houses. You get to meet and talk to different and interesting people and share information. I also like to visit places that are off the beaten track. Being somewhere with thousands of other tourists? It’s not my cup of tea."
