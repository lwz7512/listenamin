    "txt": "The whole world is fascinated by UFOs. Do they exist or don’t they? I bet you know someone who says they have seen a UFO. Probably someone a little crazy. If you think about it, UFOs are real. There are many things flying around in space and scientists don’t know what they are. That means they are unidentified flying objects, UFOs. Now, it’s a different matter about UFOs being space ships full of little green men. I’m not sure that’s true. I’m sure if aliens in space ships traveled all the way to Earth, they would pop in and say hello. I’m also sure that if there were UFOs flying around our galaxy, NASA telescopes could spot them. One day, our space ships will be UFOs and we’ll be the aliens."
