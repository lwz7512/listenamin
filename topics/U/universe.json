It’s funny when scientists say they want to unlock the secrets of the universe. That’s impossible. There are way too many secrets out there. The universe has given us an adjective in English that is misused. When we say something is universal, it doesn’t make sense. That’s because we’re saying it takes place or happens all around the universe, when in fact, it only happens on Earth. Another strange use of the word universe is that people talk about their universe. Sometimes they say their universe collapsed when something sad happened. Scientists even call our brain a mini universe."
