    "txt": "University is one of the happiest times of our life, if you go to university, that is. I totally loved my university days. I also loved my university. I had three great years of being a student. It was the first time I lived alone, without my parents. I had to cook, wash and clean for myself. I loved it. I had complete freedom. I also loved the studying. It was much more interesting than studying at school. It was nice to just wander along to a lecture, do the reading and then do the assignments. I really felt like I was learning something. I also loved the social life at university. Itâ€™s almost 24/7. There are always parties and things to do. You have to get the right balance between studying and partying."
