    "txt": "I really don't understand why Valentine's Day is so popular around the world. I have never liked it, from when I was a kid. I used to get embarrassed and go bright red if I got a Valentine's Day card. I also felt bad if I didn't get a card. We had a Valentine's Day \"delivery service\" at our school. You posted your card in the special mailbox. The teachers would then deliver the cards to the \"lucky\" students. The \"unlucky\" students probably felt bad, unloved and ugly. Valentine's Day should be every day. If you love someone, tell them every day. You should also buy them presents, flowers and take them to dinner very often â€“ not just once a year. Valentine's is horribly commercial these days, isn't it? I hate it. "
