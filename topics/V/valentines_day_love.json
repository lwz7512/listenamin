    "txt": "Valentine's Day is one of my favourite days of the year. I've always liked it, even from when I was a kid. I used to get lots of cards and then wonder who sent them to me. I'm married today, but Valentine's is still a special day for me. I spend a lot of money on a giant Valentine's Day card, chocolates, a teddy bear, and other presents. I also reserve a table at a romantic Italian or French restaurant. It's also great getting presents and chocolates back. It seems that the whole world is in love on February the 14th. I wish it could be Valentine's Day every day. I really think it should be a national holiday. That way, we can all get to spend a wonderful, love-filled, romantic day with that extra-special person in our life."
