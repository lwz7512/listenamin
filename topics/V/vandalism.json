    "txt": "Vandalism is a problem that is only in some countries, but I think it is spreading. When I grew up there was vandalism everywhere. It was almost part of growing up. The kids at my school all dared each other to vandalize something. It’s totally stupid behaviour. I don’t understand why someone thinks it’s good fun to destroy a telephone box or smash the windows of a shop. In many countries I have been to, I have seen no signs of vandalism at all. Why are some countries full of vandals and other countries aren’t? It’s funny, because the countries with the most vandals are the ones that say they are the best. I think children should be taught about the problem of vandalism at school."
