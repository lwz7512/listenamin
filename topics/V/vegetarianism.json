    "txt": "If everyone in the world was a vegetarian, I think the world would be a better place. There simply isn’t enough land any more for cows and sheep to feed on. We are losing too many forests because farmers want more land to raise cows so we can eat beef. Vegetarianism is one way to help the Earth. It’s also one way to help ourselves. So many of us are fat because we eat too much meat. If we were all vegetarian, we would all be healthier. We all need to eat more vegetables. That’s the easiest way of looking after our health. If we were all vegetarian, we would also save lots of money on healthcare. We wouldn’t have all the heart problems that you get with eating meat. I wonder if we can all stop eating meat."
