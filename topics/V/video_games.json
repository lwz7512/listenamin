    "txt": "Video games have taken over the world. They have definitely taken over my children’s world. It’s all they talk about. PlayStation this, Nintendo Wii that. I’m not happy about it. I limit the amount of time they spend playing games to an hour a day. They play their games, get it out of their system, and then do their homework. After that they go to the park to run around. This is important. Too many children don’t get enough exercise because they spend half the day playing games. They are pretty addictive. Once you start playing a game, you want to do more or go to the next level. The Wii is OK. At least you can get some exercise while you play it. It’s actually very good fun. Still not as good as real exercise though."
