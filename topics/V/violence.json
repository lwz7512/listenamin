    "txt": "Why is the world so full of violence? I think violence must be a strong part of our personality. So many of us use it to resolve a problem, or even to have fun. There’s absolutely no need for it at all. Even the world’s most intelligent people resort to violence. Surely the world’s leaders understand using violence against another country is a good way to resolve problems. The most violent people in our world are those who order armies to kill other people. Except they don’t call it violence. They call it “fighting for freedom”, “fighting for peace” or some equally stupid phrase. There is also too much violence in our societies. There’s domestic violence, sexual violence, street violence, violent crime… It’s all over the news. Every time you turn on the TV, there’s a story on violence."
