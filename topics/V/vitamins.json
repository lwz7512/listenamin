    "txt": "Our bodies need vitamins, that’s a fact. If we don’t get enough vitamins, we become ill. But how do we know if we’re getting enough vitamins. I worry about that. Especially because a lot of the food I eat isn’t so healthy. I wonder how many vitamins there are in pizza and French fries. I know I should eat more fruit and vegetables – that’s where the vitamins are. I thought about buying vitamin pills and vitamin supplements. But then I didn’t like the idea of this. I read these are not so good for you. I really need to read up on vitamins. I have no idea what they do. Where do I get vitamin A and what does it do? I know vitamin C comes from fruit. I guess I should start eating more fruit."
