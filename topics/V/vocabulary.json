    "txt": "I love vocabulary. It’s so interesting. I keep a vocabulary notebook and write down all the new words that I think are interesting. If I see or hear an English word I write it down and look up the meaning in a dictionary. I then see if there are other words that belong to the family of my new word. For example, the other day I learnt that the word ‘book’ is also a verb. It means reserve a room in a hotel. When I looked in the dictionary I also learned ‘booking’ and then ‘make a booking’ and ‘cancel a booking’. I’m glad I looked at this word because my vocabulary has increased a little more – it was easy. After that my friend told me ‘mean’ has many meanings. I’m going to find out what they are right now."
