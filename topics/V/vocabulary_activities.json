They are great fun and Iâ€™m sure that helps us remember the words and phrases. He makes us do the same activity again and again but changes the order of the words. Eventually, I get 100 per cent. When I was at school, I learnt vocab from lists. That was really boring. My new teacher has shown me lots of different activities to remember vocab. He taught us to look for word patterns and focus on the family of a word. He also teaches us a lot of phrases and expressions. I really like vocabulary now, thanks to the fun activities we do in class."
