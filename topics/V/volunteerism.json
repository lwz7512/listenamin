    "txt": "Being a volunteer is one of the best things you can do with your life. It’s a great way to help other people. It’s also very satisfying to know that you are not wasting your time and are helping people who need help. Many of us could and should be out there doing voluntary activities of some kind. So many volunteer organizations need extra hands. It really is easy. Just pick up the phone and offer your services. I think too many of us settle into a lazy lifestyle. We just want to come home and watch TV. Life is much more interesting when you’re a volunteer. I’ve found it really opens your eyes to how some people live. It’s sometimes sad to see how the government lets people down, but at least I’m doing my bit. "
