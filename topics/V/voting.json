    "txt": "I like voting. It’s quite good fun. I feel quite important when I go to the voting station. It’s a shame it’s just once every four or five years though. I’d like to vote more. I think we should be able to vote on lots of things. If we had some voting software, we could vote every week on whatever the big issue is. I wish I had a vote when the Iraq War came. I think that war wouldn’t have happened if the people had a vote. I also think we should be able to vote when a criminal gets a sentence in court. The judge gives someone five years for murder and 25 years for stealing money. That’s wrong. Voting is part of living in a democratic country. It’s your country, so you should be able to have your say."
