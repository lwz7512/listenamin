    "txt": "War is the worst thing in the world. I've never experienced it. I've never seen it. I never want to. Just looking at it on television is enough. What is war? It's when leaders think they have to be strong so they attack another country and kill more civilians than soldiers. That's war today. Generals and presidents always apologize for the loss of innocent lives, but their image as a strong man (or woman) is more important than the suffering and misery their decisions lead to. There are many examples of wars ending or being avoided through talking. But then talking doesn't feed the war machine. Lots of people get rich when their country goes to war. And we learn in our history books that we are \"good\" at war, so it's OK. "
