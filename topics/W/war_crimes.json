They then make them into monsters and say they are guilty of terrible war crimes. This is probably true. They are guilty of war crimes. The strange thing is, countries like America and Britain can attack other countries and kill thousands of innocent civilians but no one is a war criminal. Hundreds of people can die in a bombing and their leaders call it \"collateral damage\" or an accident. I think we need to look again at what a war crime is. If a major world power drops a bomb on my house by mistake, someone must be responsible for that. "
