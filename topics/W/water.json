    "txt": "Few people think about how important water is. We do when we're really thirsty. I remember hiking for hours in really baking sun without anything to drink. I was dreaming about drinking cool water. And when I came to a small river, the water was delicious. And cool. But that was years ago. I think the water in that river is polluted today and dangerous to drink. That's sad. When I was a kid, water was fun. You could splash around in it and drink it in the countryside. Not today though. Water is becoming more and more precious. In fact, there will soon be wars over water. We really need to start thinking more about water and how we can conserve it. Some countries use crazy amounts of water. "
