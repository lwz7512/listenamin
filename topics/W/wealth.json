    "txt": "There's so much wealth in the world. And there's so much poverty and suffering. Thousands of billionaires live like kings and queens while billions go hungry. They show off their wealth to each other. They fill their gigantic mansions with all the trappings of wealth. They must have luxury cars, expensive artwork and over-priced jewelry. I wonder if these people ever think about how much a tiny part of their wealth could help others. Many billionaires could give billions of dollars away and never even notice it has gone. But that money could help millions of people around the world. If the rich shared their wealth, millions of starving children could eat. I suppose greed is a big part of being wealthy. You just want more. "
