    "txt": "Weapons are among the world's biggest killers. I'm sure weapons are deadlier than diseases in some countries. I think we could do without weapons. The world would be a better place. Every time I turn on the news, there's another gun crime, another knifing, another lost life. Weapons are getting out of control. It seems you can't be cool at school any more unless you have a knife. Many kids carry a gun to school in some countries. The worst weapons aren't those that criminals carry. No. The worst weapons are the ones our leaders are in control of. The weapons of mass destruction that kill thousands of innocent lives. These weapons can destroy a whole city. It's time we got rid of them. "
