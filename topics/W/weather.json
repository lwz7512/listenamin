    "txt": "The weather means different things to different people. I come from England, so the weather is always a big topic there. People in England can't deal with the weather. A tiny bit of snow, and no one goes to work. Two days of thirty-degree temperatures and it's a heatwave. Three days and it's an emergency. I once lived in Dubai. No one really talked about the weather there. It was the same almost every day of the year. Hot, sunny, blue skies, no rain. I never looked at the weather forecast. I always knew what the weather would be like. Not like in England where people pray for the weather to be OK. But the weather is changing. Global warming is making it rain in the desert and dry in the rainforests. "
