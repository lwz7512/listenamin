    "txt": "Thirty years ago, no one had ever heard of the word 'website'. Today, websites are one of the most important parts of our daily life. We can't get by most days without visiting one website or another. We have to log on to a website at work or send an essay or paper to our teacher. And then there are the websites we use for fun. Millions of people visit gaming websites every day. They play games with people on the other side of the world. We also use websites to communicate. We send mail, chat, talk via web cams, and video conference. Nowadays we even make friends on websites like Facebook and Twitter. Many of us have our own website. We call it our-name.com and fill it with photos and our thoughts on life. "
