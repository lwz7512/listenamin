    "txt": "You're in big trouble if you forget a wedding anniversary. Especially if it's your own. I wonder who would be in bigger trouble, the husband or the wife. Most people would expect the wife to remember her wedding anniversary and the husband to forget it. I'm not so sure. I think the man might be better at remembering. There's more pressure on him to buy flowers, book a restaurant, and generally do the right thing. If the guy is really clever, he'll choose a wedding day that falls on an easy-to-remember date. You should never really forget the big anniversaries. Ten years, 25 years, your golden wedding anniversary at 50 years. I hope to see my diamond anniversary â€“ that's 60 years. Don't know what's after that. What's 100 years? "
