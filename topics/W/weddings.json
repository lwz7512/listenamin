    "txt": "You can't beat a good wedding. I love going to weddings. It's a good excuse to dress up in your best clothes, meet lots of family and friends and have a party. Let's not forget, it's also the most important day in the lives of the happy couple. The whole day is happy. I like church weddings the best. I love the sound of the bells and the organ playing \"Here comes the bride\". Everyone and everything looks great at a wedding. The best bit is at the end, when the bride and groom make their vows and then say, \"I do\". I want my wedding day to be the best ever. I want all my friends at my wedding reception and I want the best man to make a funny speech. And then it's off to somewhere exotic for my honeymoon. "
