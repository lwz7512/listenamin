    "txt": "So many people worry about their weight. And so many people never worry about their weight but they should. I think my weight is OK. I'm rarely overweight and I've never been underweight. I find it very easy to stick to the same weight. All I need to do is watch what I eat and do a little exercise. When you open a magazine, you see pages of ads telling usÂ  to watch our weight. There are dozens of slim young people with perfect bodies telling us we can be like them. All we need to do is buy the how-to-lose-weight book for $50. I lost 15 kg once. It was easy. No lunch for 6 months and lots of exercise. The problem is, I stopped exercising and put it all back again. It's easy to gain weight if you're not careful. "
