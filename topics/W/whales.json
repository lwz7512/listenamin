    "txt": "Whales are absolutely beautiful creatures. It's amazing to think how big they are. But I guess they're a tiny dot when they're in the ocean. I think whales are among the most interesting animals on Earth. Are they animals or fish? I know they are mammals, so I guess that might make them animals. One day, I really want to go whale watching. I think it's one of those must-do things in life. I suppose I'd better do this soon before all the whales die out. I worry about the future of whales. It seems humans are doing everything they can to make lots of species extinct. Some countries take part in whaling and others destroy the oceans so whales can't eat. One day, we'll only see dead whales in museums. "
