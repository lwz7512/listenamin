    "txt": "Winter is my favourite season. I love everything about it. I like the cold weather, which always makes the sky seem so blue. I also like being able to see my breath in the cold air. In summer, it's difficult to keep cool outside, but in winter, it's easy to keep warm. I really like hiking in winter. The cold really makes you feel alive. It's also great getting home to a nice warm room. Winter also has the best holidays. I love getting together with my family and then celebrating the New Year. Winter is a really good time to go on vacation because the sights are usually empty. If you go anywhere in Europe in winter, you can be sure of getting a hotel room and you never have to wait to get into a museum. "
