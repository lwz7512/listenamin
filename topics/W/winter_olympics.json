I’d rather be a competitor in the summer games – it’s warmer. The winter Olympics are definitely the most beautiful. Looking at skiers come down a snowy slope against a blue sky is a wonderful sight. I also love the winter Olympics because of the skating. It’s amazing watching the speeds the speed skaters reach – they’re so fast. I also think the figure skaters put on a fantastic show. Another winter Olympic event I like is the luge – I think people have to be crazy to sit on almost nothing and shoot down an ice tunnel at high speeds. I wonder who will win the most gold medals. Maybe it’ll be Norway, or Russia."
