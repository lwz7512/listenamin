    "txt": "\"Half of man is woman.\" That's a Chinese expression. I think it means half of the population is female and we are all equal. But we're not really equal. Women have a much harder time in life than men. Lots of women in developed countries have an OK life, but women in developing countries have a terrible time. They have to look after the family, and their husband's family, cook, have children and farm the fields. They need to be incredibly strong. I think women are stronger than men. They need to be with what they have to put up with. I also think they're more sensible than men. But are they more intelligent than men? No. I think men and women are equally intelligent. Except when it comes to reading a map. "
