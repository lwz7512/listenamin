    "txt": "The world is full of words. They are everywhere we look, everywhere we hear. Words also fill our head. Words have the power to fill us with every emotion we can imagine, and some we can't imagine. The words in a beautiful poem or song can make us cry, hope and laugh. It all starts with a 'mama' or 'dada'. They are our first words. Soon after that our parents tell us not to say bad words. Then it's a lifetime of building up our vocabulary. Some of us even want to learn thousands of words in another language. I wonder how many words we can remember. Thousands and thousands. But sometimes you don't need many. If someone says \"I want a few words with you\" I get worried. "
