    "txt": "I like the word 'yes'. I much prefer hearing it than hearing 'no'. Yes is a very positive word. It means things can go ahead. You always hope the answer will be yes when you ask a question. The biggest question I asked was when I proposed to my wife. I was so happy when she said yes. Other times I like hearing this word is if I ask an interviewer if I got the job. I often say yes when I'm really happy or have done something really difficult. Even if I play a good shot at tennis I say 'yes' to myself. Even though it is a short word, it has many meanings depending on how you say it. You can express so many different emotions using just this word. Sometimes, 'yes' can mean 'no'. I think I say yes more than I say no. "
